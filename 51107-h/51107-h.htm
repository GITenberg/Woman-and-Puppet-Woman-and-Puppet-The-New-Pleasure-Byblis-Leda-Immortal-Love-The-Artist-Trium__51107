<h2><a name="TRANSLATORS_NOTE" id="TRANSLATORS_NOTE"></a><i>TRANSLATOR’S NOTE</i></h2>

<p><i>About twelve years ago Oscar Wilde dedicated his
beautiful <span class="smcap">Salome</span> thus: “À mon Ami Pierre Louÿs.”
At that time not many gentlemen in England knew the
name of the writer who was to become famous throughout
the Land of the Mind as author of <span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span>.
His earliest fame here was to be enshrined in that
dedication. Afterwards, in <span class="smcap">The Spirit Lamp</span>, he
had the honour and pleasure of putting into a French
sonnet one of the prose poems that Wilde used to put
into the post as letters. Suddenly, about ten years ago,
every one in the republic of French letters was praising
a new and wonderful book, <span class="smcap">Aphrodite</span>. It was the
most amazing study of antiquity since the <span class="smcap">Salambo</span> of
Flaubert or the Mary Magdalen of Edgar Saltus.
The beautiful girl in the romance by Louÿs captivated a
continent. She was, indeed</i>, mystérieuse et victorieuse.
<i>But he did not stop. His waiting world soon had from
him the <span class="smcap">Chansons de Bilitis</span>. An English wit, one
of the few, said they were <span class="smcap">Chances of Debility</span>.
His phrase saves trouble, but one can say that these prose
chansons were a picture of Sapphic life and love of a
very febrile sort. There is quite a lot of that in
modern French literature. It is a mode of the moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
Louÿs then passed to the writing of the superb little
books <span class="smcap">Lêda</span>, <span class="smcap">Byblis</span>, <span class="smcap">The Artist Triumphant</span>,
and <span class="smcap">A New Pleasure</span>. They are here translated.
The narrative Louÿs called <span class="smcap">The Adventures of
King Pausolus</span> was of the whimsy story type. It
brought to the minds of well-read men such things as
Uchard’s tale <span class="smcap">Mon Oncle Barbassou</span>. It also
clearly informed the reader that Louÿs was French, and
that even in the telling of a harmless romance the strip
of water between England and France is a strip that
also flows between two antipolar view-points. But
Louÿs at last came to the writing of <span class="smcap">Woman and
Puppet</span>, and wrote something of deepest human intent.
A version of it follows. The very curious story entitled
<span class="smcap">The Hill of Horsel</span> shows the fusing of fact and
fiction, antiquity and to-day. It is a most interesting
effort, and achievement, in a form of story that Poe,
Gautier and D’Aurevilly also perfected.</i></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>In Spain the Carnival does not finish,
as in France, at eight o’clock on the
morning of Ash Wednesday. Over the
wonderful gaiety of Seville the memory
that “<em>dust we are</em>,” etc., spreads its odour
of sepulture for four days only, and the
first Sunday of Lent all the Carnival
reawakens.</p>

<p>It is the <i lang="es">Domingo de Pinatas</i>, or the
Sunday of Marmites, the Grand Fête.
All the populous town has changed its
costume, and one sees in the streets rags
and tatters of red, blue, green, yellow
or rose, that have been mosquito-nets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
curtains or women’s garments, all waving
in the sunlight and carried by a small
body of ragamuffins. The youngsters,
noisy, many-coloured and masked, push
their way through the crowd of great
personages.</p>

<p>At the windows one sees pressed forward
innumerable brunette heads. Nearly all
the young girls of the countryside are in
Seville on such a day as this. Paper
confetti fall as a coloured rain, fans shade
and protect pretty powdered faces, there
are cries, appeals and laughter in the
narrow streets. A few thousands of people
make more noise on this day of Carnival
than would the whole of Paris.</p>

<p>But, on the twenty-third of February in
eighteen hundred and ninety-six, André
Stévenol saw the end of the Carnival
approaching with a slight feeling of
vexation, for the week, although essentially
one of love-affairs, had not brought him
any new adventure. Some previous so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>journing
in Spain had taught him with
what quickness and freedom of the heart
the knots of friendship were tied and
untied in this still primitive land. He was
depressed at the thought that chance and
circumstance had not favoured him. He
had had a long paper battle with one young
girl. They had fought and teased each
other with the serpentine strips of Carnival
time, he in the street, she at a window.
She ran down and gave him a little red
bouquet with “Many thanks, sir.” But,
alas! she had fled quickly, and at closer
view illusions fled also. André put the
flower in his coat, but did not put the
giver in his memory.</p>

<p>Four o’clock sounded from many clocks.
He went by way of the Calle Rodrigo
and gained the Delicias, Champs-Elysées
of shading trees along the immense
Guadalquivir thronged with vessels. It
was there that unrolled the Carnival of
the elegant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>At Seville the leisured class cannot
always afford three good meals per day,
but would rather go without them than
without the outside show of a landau and
two fine horses. Seville has hundreds of
carriages, often old-fashioned but made
beautiful by their horses, and occupied by
people of noble race and face.</p>

<p>André Stévenol made a way with difficulty
through the crowd edging the two
sides of the vast dusty avenue. The battle
of eggs was on. Eggshells filled with
paper confetti were being thrown into the
carriages, and thrown back, of course.
André filled his pockets with eggs and
fought with spirit. The stream of carriages
filed past&mdash;carriages full of women, lovers,
families, children, or friends. The game
had lasted an hour when André felt in
his pocket his last egg.</p>

<p>Suddenly there again appeared a young
woman whose fan he had broken with an
egg earlier in the combat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>She was marvellous. Deprived of the
shade and shelter of the fan that had
protected her delicate, laughing features;
open on all sides to the attacks of the
crowd and the nearest carriages, she took
bravely her part in the struggle, and,
standing panting, hatless, flushed with
heat and frank gaiety, she gave and
received attacks. She appeared to be
about twenty-two years old, and must
have been at least eighteen. That she
was from Andalucia could not possibly
be doubted. She was of that admirable
type that was born of the intermixing of
Arabs and Vandals, of Semites with the
Germans. Such mixing has brought
together in a little valley of Europe all
the perfection of two races.</p>

<p>Her body, long and supple, was expressive
in every line and curve. One
felt that even were she veiled one would
be able to divine her thought, and that
she laughed with her limbs, even as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
spoke with her shoulders and her bosom,
with grace and with liberty. Her hair
was of dark chestnut, but at a distance
shone almost black. Her cheeks were
of great softness as to contour. The edges
of the eyelids were very dark.</p>

<p>André, pressed by the crowd close to
her carriage, gazed at her intently. His
heart-beats told him that this woman
would be one of those who were destined
to play a part in his life. At once he
wrote with pencil on his Carnival egg
the word “QUIERO,” and threw it as
one might a rose into her hands.</p>

<p>Quiero is an astonishing verb. It is
“to will,” “to desire,” “to love.” It is
“to go in quest of,” it is “to cherish.”
In turn, and according to how used, it
expresses an imperative passion, or a light
caprice. It is a prayer or an order, a
declaration or a condescension. Often it
is but an irony. André looked as he
gave it the look that can mean “I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
love to love you.” She put the curious
missive in a sort of hand-bag, and the
stream of traffic took her on. André lost
sight of her after a vain attempt to follow.</p>

<p>Saddened he slowly returned. For him
all the Carnival was shrouded and ended.
Should he have been more determined
and found a way in the crowd? How
could he find her again? It was not
certain that she lived in Seville. If not,
it might be impossible to find her. And
little by little, by an unhappy illusion,
the image that his mind held of her
became more charming. Certain details
of her sweet features that had only won
a moment’s curious notice now became
transmuted in the crucible of memory
into the principal things that made up
her tender attitude. There was a certain
detail in the dressing of the hair, an extreme
mobility in the corners of the lips.
The latter changed each instant in form
and expression. Often almost hidden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
often almost curved upwards, rounded,
slender, pale or darkened, animated, so
to speak, with a varying flame of life
and soul. Ah! perhaps one could blame
all the rest of that face&mdash;say that the nose
was not Grecian, the chin not Roman;
but not to colour with pleasure at the
sight of those little lip-corners was to be
past all forgiveness in this world.</p>

<p>So his thoughts flew on and on till a
voice cried behind him rough but warning:
a carriage was passing quickly in the
narrow street. In the carriage was a
young woman who, when she saw André
threw gently towards him, as one would
throw a rose, an egg inscribed “Quiero.”</p>

<p>But, now, after the word there was a
decided flourish. It was as if the fair one
had wished to reply by stressing his own
one-word message.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>


</div><div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>Her carriage had turned the corner of
the street. André went in pursuit, anxious
not to lose a second chance that might be
the last. He arrived as the horses went
through the gates of a house in the Plaza
del Triunfo. The great black gates closed
upon the rapidly caught silhouette of a
woman.</p>

<p>Without doubt it would have been wiser
if he had prepared to learn the name and
family, or mode of life of the stranger,
before bursting into all the divine unknown
of any such intrigue, in which, knowing
nothing, he could not be master of anything.
André nevertheless resolved not to quit
the place without a first effort to find out
something. He deliberately rang the gate
bell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>A young custodian came, but did not
open the gates.</p>

<p>“What does Your Grace demand?”</p>

<p>“Take my card to the Señora.”</p>

<p>“To what Señora?”</p>

<p>“To the one who lives here, I presume.”</p>

<p>“But her name?”</p>

<p>“I say that your mistress awaits me.”</p>

<p>The man bowed and made a deprecatory
sign with his hands, then retired without
opening the gates or taking the card.</p>

<p>Then André rang a second and third
time. Anger had made him discourteous.</p>

<p>“A woman so prompt to reply to a
declaration of this type,” he thought, “cannot
be surprised that one insists upon
trying to see her.” It did not occur to
him that the Carnival and the bacchanal
forgives passing follies, that are not usually
permitted in normal social life.</p>

<p>What was to be done? He paced to
and fro, but there was no sight of her and
no sign. Near the house was a stall-keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
whom André bribed and questioned. But
the man replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“The Señora purchases of me, but if
she knew I talked of her to any one she
would buy of my rivals. I can only tell
you her name: she is the Señora Dona
Concepcion Perez, wife of Don Manuel
Garcia. Her husband is in Bolivia.”</p>

<p>André heard no more, but returned to
his hotel and remained there undecided.
Even upon learning of the absence of the
Señora’s husband, he had not also learnt
that all the chances were upon his side.
The reserve of the dealer, who seemed to
know more than he would care to say,
rather left one with the idea that there was
another and luckier lover already chosen
and enthroned. The attitude of the servant
at the gates increased this awkward afterthought.</p>

<p>André had to return to Paris in two
weeks’ time. Would those weeks suffice
for planning and effecting an entry into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the life of a beautiful young dame, whose
life was without much doubt planned,
rounded, complete?</p>

<p>While thus troubled with his incertitudes
a letter was handed to him. It had no
address on the envelope. He said, “Are
you sure that this letter is for me?”</p>

<p>“It has just been given to me for Don
Andrés Stévenol.”</p>

<p>The letter was written upon a blue card,
and was as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don Andrés Stévenol is begged to
not make so much noise, to not give his
name or demand to know mine. If he is
out walking to-morrow about three on the
Empalme route a carriage will be passing.
It may stop.”</p>

<p>André thought how easy life was, and
already had visions of approaching intimacy.
He even sought for and murmured the
most tender little forms of her charming
Christian name Concepcion, Concha, Conchita,
Chita.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>



</div><div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>On the morning of the morrow André
Stévenol had a radiant awakening. The
light flooded his room, which had four
windows. There also came to him the
murmurs of the town. There were the
feet of horses passing, street cries, mules’
bells, and the bells of convents.</p>

<p>He could not recall having known a
morning as happy as this present one was;
no, not for a long time. He flung out his
arms and stretched them; then held them
tightly folded around his breast as though
to give himself the illusion or the anticipation
of that eagerly awaited embrace.</p>

<p>“How easy, how simple the affairs of
life are, after all!” So he mused, smiling.
“Yesterday, at this hour I was alone, without
an object to fill my mind, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
without a thought. It was merely necessary
to take a walk and, behold! a change
of scene, a love-affair in view. What is
the use of taking any notice of refusals,
of disdain, or any such things. We desire
and demand, and the women give
themselves. Why should it ever be otherwise?”</p>

<p>He rose, and in dressing-gown and
slippers rang for his bath to be prepared.
Whilst waiting with his forehead
pressed to the window-panes he stared
into the thoroughfare before him, now full
of the stir of day. The houses in sight
were painted in light colours that Seville
favours as a rule: colours like the gay
tints of women’s dresses&mdash;cream, rose,
green, orange, violet, but not the fearful
brown of Cadiz or Madrid, or the crude
white of Jérez. There were orange-trees
in sight, bearing fruit; running fountains
and laughing girls, holding their shawls
close. From all sides come the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the mules’ bells. André could not then
imagine any other place in which to live
but&mdash;Seville.</p>

<p>He finished dressing, and slowly sipped
a little cup of the thick Spanish chocolate,
then, easy in mind, almost aimlessly he
went out into the busy street.</p>

<p>By chance he went the shortest way, to
the Plaza del Triunfo. Then he remembered
that he was not to haunt the residence
of his “mistress,” as he called her
to himself, so he went to Las Delicias.
The place was strewn with paper and the
usual signs of the Carnival. It was also
deserted, for Lent had recommenced.
Nevertheless, by a way that led from the
city’s outskirts, André saw coming towards
him one whom he recognized.</p>

<p>“Good-day, Don Mateo,” he said, holding
out his hand. “I had not thought of
seeing you so soon.”</p>

<p>“Well, here I am, alone, idle and at a
loose end. I stroll about in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and evening, and fill up most of the day
reading or playing in some way. It’s a
dull sort of existence.”</p>

<p>“But you have nights that console the
monotony of the days, if one may credit
the chatter of the city busybody?”</p>

<p>“Whoever says so says wrongly. From
now to the day of his death Don Mateo
Diaz has no woman about him. But do
not let us talk about me. For how long
are you still going to remain here?”</p>

<p>Don Mateo was a Spaniard, forty years
old, to whom André had been introduced
during his first stay in Spain. He was a man
of florid phrase and declamatory gesture,
very rich, and famed for his love affairs.
So André was surprised to hear that he
had renounced the pomps and vanities of
the flesh, but did not attempt to weary
him with questions.</p>

<p>They walked by the river for a time, and
all their talk was of Spain, its people, its
policy, and history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, “You will come and break your
fast or lunch,” said Don Mateo. “My
place is there, near the route D’Empalme.
We shall be there in a half-hour, and, if
you will permit me, I will keep you till the
evening. I have some fine horses I should
like to show off before you.”</p>

<p>“I agree to take lunch with you,” said
André, “but I cannot stay. This evening
I have a rendezvous that I must not fail
to keep; that is a fact.”</p>

<p>“A lady ... I ask no questions. But
stay as long as you can. When I was
your age I did not want to be bothered
with the outer world during my ’days of
mystery.’ The only person I loved to
speak to on such days was the woman of
the moment.”</p>

<p>Don Mateo was silent for a while, then
said in a tone of advice&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah, guard yourself against the
women! I should be the last man to say
fly from them, for I have spent my life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
upon them until now. And if I had my
life to live again, the hours passed with
women are those I would most desire
to revive. But guard yourself; guard
yourself!”</p>

<p>Then, as though he had found a phrase
that fitted exactly to his thoughts, Don
Mateo added more slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>“There are two kinds of women that
one should avoid, at all cost: those who
do not love you, and those who do. Between
these two extremes there are
thousands of women of great charm, but
we do not know how to appreciate them.”</p>

<p>The lunch would have been very slow
indeed if the animation of Don Mateo had
not replaced by a monologue the interchange
of thought for thought that should
have taken place. André was mentally
preoccupied, and only appeared to hear the
half of what his host said to him. As the
hour of his assignation drew nearer, the
throbbing of his heart, as on the Carnival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
day, came back to him, but intensified. It
was a kind of persistent appeal within him,
and all thoughts save the thought of the
longed-for woman were driven out of him.
He would have given much for the hands
of the dial near him to have pointed to
the next hour, but the face of the clock
was cold to his emotion, and time would
no more flow than the water of a stagnant
pond.</p>

<p>At last, almost incapable of holding his
tongue any longer, he surprised his host by
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don Mateo, you have always given me
the best advice. May I confide a secret
to you and appeal to your advice again?”</p>

<p>“I am entirely yours,” replied the
Spaniard, rising and making for the smoking-room.</p>

<p>“I would not ask any one but you,” said
André hesitatingly. “Do you know a
lady of Seville named Donna Concepcion
Garcia?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mateo leaped up, then rapidly uttered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Concepcion Garcia! Concepcion Garcia!
But which one? Explain. There are
twenty thousand Concepcion Garcias, in
Spain to-day. It is a name as common
as Jeanne Duval or Marie Lambert in
France. For Heaven’s sake tell me what
is her other name. Is it Perez, Concha
Perez?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said André, completely astonished.</p>

<p>Then Don Mateo continued in precise
tones&mdash;</p>

<p>“Concepcion Perez de Garcia: twenty-two,
Plaza del Triunfo, eighteen years old,
hair almost black, and a mouth, Heavens
what a divine mouth!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” again answered André.</p>

<p>“Ah! You have done well to mention
her name. If I can stop you at the gate
in this affair, it will be a good action on my
part, and a piece of good luck for you!”</p>

<p>“Is she a girl who would go to the arms
of any one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. She has had but few lovers.
For these times, she is chaste and very
intelligent, with wit and a knowledge of
life. She dances with eloquence, speaks
as well as she dances, and sings equally
well. Have I said enough?”</p>

<p>André could hardly get a word out before
Don Mateo resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>“And she is the worst of women.
I hope that God will never pardon
her!”</p>

<p>André rose as if to go.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Don Mateo, I&mdash;who am
not yet able to speak of this woman as you
are&mdash;I, at present, am still less able to fail
to keep an assignation she has made with
me. I have made you a confession, and
I regret to break yours by a premature
departure.” He held out his hand.</p>

<p>Mateo placed himself before the door.</p>

<p>“Hear me, I beg of you. I speak to
you, man to man, and I say Stop! return
as you came. Forget who you have seen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
who has spoken to you and written to you.
If you would know peace, calm nights and
a life lacking in black care, <em>do not approach
Concha Perez</em>! Do not approach this
woman. Let me save you. Have mercy
upon yourself, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Don Mateo. Do you then love
her?...”</p>

<p>The Spaniard stroked his forehead, and
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh no! I do not now love or hate.
It is all over and done with, all trace
effaced.”</p>

<p>Mateo gazed at André, then, quite
changing to a tone of banter, said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Besides, one should never go to
the first rendezvous a woman gives
one.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because she never comes there.”</p>

<p>A memory of an affair made André
smile, and admit it was often true.</p>

<p>“Very often. And if by chance she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
comes, be sure <em>your</em> absence will deepen
her liking for you.”</p>

<p>A short silence came. They had reseated
themselves, and Mateo said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now listen, please.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>Three years ago I had not the grey
hairs that you now see, and was thirty-seven
years of age, though I felt but
twenty-two. I do not know precisely
when my youth passed from me, and it is
hard for me to realize that it has reached
its end. People have told you that I was
one of the gadabouts of passion. That
is false. I respected Love and I never
degraded her. Scarcely ever have I
caressed a woman whom I did not passionately
love. If I were to name or number
these loves to you you would be surprised
for they were but a few. I easily remember
that I have never loved a blonde. I
have always ignored those pale objects of
worship. What is furthermore true, is
that, for me, love has not been a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
pleasure or pastime. It has been my very
life. If I were to take out of my life all the
thoughts and actions that had the woman
for their sole end, there would remain
nothing but emptiness&mdash;space. This much
said, I may now recount to you what I
know of Concha Perez.</p>

<p>I go first to three years and a half ago,
and winter-time. I returned from France,
a bitter cold journey too, one twenty-sixth
of December, in the express that
passes the bridge of the Bidassoa.</p>

<p>The snow, already very thick at Biarritz
and Saint Sebastian, rendered almost
impracticable the traversing of the Guipuzcoa.
The train stopped two hours at
Zumarraga, for snow to be cleared away.
Later an avalanche stopped us for three
hours. All night this snow trouble went
on. Sounds were deadened by the fall,
and so we were travelling in a silence to
which danger gave a touch of grandeur.</p>

<p>The morning of the morrow found us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
at Avila. We were eight hours late, and
had fasted for a day. We learnt at last
that we should be “hung up” at that place
four days! Do you know Avila by any
chance? It is the place that they should
send those people to who rave about Old
Spain being dead and done with. The
inn I stopped at, Don Quixote could easily
have used also.</p>

<p>In resuming my journey I went third-class,
for a change, in a compartment
nearly full of Spanish women. There
were really four compartments with partitions
about shoulder high.</p>

<p>Well, we were passing the Sierra of
Guadarrama, and suddenly the train stopped
again. We were blocked by another avalanche.
When we realized this there was
a general request made to a gitana present
to dance.</p>

<p>She did dance: a woman about thirty,
of the ugly gipsy type, but she seemed to
have fire in the fingers that flashed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
castanets and fire in her limbs. Everyone
knelt and listened, or beat time with
their hands. I now noticed in the corner
facing me a young girl, who was singing.</p>

<p>She wore a rose-coloured skirt, that
made me guess she was from Andalucia&mdash;that
colour-loving province.</p>

<p>Her shoulders and bosom were swathed
in a creamy shawl, and she had a throat
scarf of white foulard to protect her from
the cold. The whole carriage already
knew that she was trained at the Convent
of San José d’Avila, was going to Madrid
to find her mother, and bore the name of
Concha Perez.</p>

<p>Her voice was singularly penetrating.
She sang without moving her body about,
hands in shawl, eyes closed.</p>

<p>The songs she was singing were not
taught her by the Sisters, I can be quite
sure. They were the little songs of four
lines, only loved by the people. Into
these quatrains they put much passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I can hear again in memory the caress
in her voice as she sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Thy bed is of jasmins,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thy sheets of white roses;</div>
  <div class="verse">Of lilies thy pillows,</div>
  <div class="verse">And a dark rose there poses.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There followed an angry scene between
her and the gipsy. They fought, but I
stepped between, for I loathe to see women
fighting. They do it badly and dangerously.
When it was all over, a gendarme
came, and after slapping Concha upon the
cheeks put her in another compartment.
The train now went forward again, and
my companions began to sleep. The
image of the little singer tormented me.
Where had he put her? I leant over the
barrier of my carriage, and saw that she
was there, close enough to touch. She
was sleeping like a tired child. I saw the
closed lids, the long lashes, the little nose
and two small lips, that seemed to be at
one and the same time infantile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sensual. Gazing for a long time at those
amazing lips, I wondered whether their
dream movements were recalling the
breast that nursed her or the lips of a
lover.</p>

<p>Daylight came, and with it the end of
the journey. I aided the little Concha to
get together six parcels, and offered to
carry them but was refused. She managed
with them somehow, and ran off.
I soon lost sight of her.</p>

<p>You see, do you not, this first meeting
was insignificant, almost vague. She had
interested and amused me for a little while.
That was really all. Soon I ceased to
think of her at all.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>



</div><div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>The following summer I found her
again. In August, I was alone in my
house, a house that a feminine presence
had filled for years. One afternoon, bored
to death, I visited the Government Tobacco
Manufactory of Seville. It was a sweltering
day. I entered alone, which was a
favour, in this immense harem of about
five thousand women-workers, of a rather
free-and-easy type.</p>

<p>I have said the day was terribly hot?
Most of the workers were half-dressed
only. It was a mixed spectacle, certainly:
a sort of panorama of women at all ages.
I passed along, sometimes being asked for
a gift, sometimes being given a cynical
pleasantry. Suddenly I recognized Concha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and asked her what brought her into that
place.</p>

<p>“Heaven knows, I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“But your convent training?”</p>

<p>“When girls go there through the door,
they leave through the window.”</p>

<p>“Did you?”</p>

<p>“I will be honest with you. I didn’t
enter at all for fear of sinning. Give me
a coin, and I will sing you something while
the superintendent is away from here.”</p>

<p>Then she told me she lived with her
mother, and came to the factory when in
the mood. I gave her a napoléon, and
then left.</p>

<p>In the youth of happy men there is a
moment, an instant, that chance decides.
My moment came when I dropped that
golden coin before that girl. It was as if
I had thrown a fatal die. I date from
then and there my actual life, “the life I
have lived the most.” My moral ruin was
then begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>You shall know all; the actual story is
simple enough, truly.</p>

<p>I left the State Factory, and walked
slowly into the shadowless street. There
she rejoined me, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I thank you; sir.”</p>

<p>I noted that her voice had changed.
The golden gift had evoked in her the
emotion that comes with the desire for
wealth. She asked me to conduct her
home to the Calle Manteros, quite near.</p>

<p>She told me she had no sweetheart, and
I then replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“Surely, not through piety?”</p>

<p>“I am pious, but I haven’t taken any
vows.”</p>

<p>Finally she said that she was virginal,
and had kept herself pure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


</div><div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>


<p>She admitted this with such a directness,
such an air, that I quite flushed and
felt ill at ease. Whatever was passing in
that childish-looking head, behind that
face so provoking, so rebellious? What
signified her decided moral attitude, her
frank and, possibly, honest eye, her
sensuous mouth that seemed to tempt and
yet defy. All that I really knew was
that she pleased me vastly, that I was
enchanted to have found her again, and
looked forward to finding other chances
of being with her. We reached her
home. Down-stairs at the doorway I
bought her some mandarines. At the
top floor she gave three little knocks at
a door and I stood before her mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
a dark woman, who had once been
beautiful.</p>

<p>Then began confidences; they seemed
endless. The mother said she was the
widow of an engineer, and told me a
story I had heard elsewhere twenty times.</p>

<p>“Ah, Caballero, we should have been
rich, we two, had we but followed evil
ways. But sin has never passed the
evening here!”</p>

<p>Conchita during this discourse was putting
powder on her cheeks. She turned to
me with a smile transfiguring her mouth.</p>

<p>Finally I laid down four banknotes and
arranged that Conchita was not to return
to the factory. I called again the next
day. She was alone. That day she
came and sat upon my knees and kissed
me with her burning mouth. I left but
to return, alas! not once, but twenty
times more. I was in love like the
youngest, the most foolish of men. You
must have known such madness yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and will understand me. Each time I
left her rooms I counted the hours until
the next meeting, and those hours
never seemed to go. Little by little
I got to pass the whole day with
them, paying all the expenses and the
debts too. This cost me a good deal of
money. How Conchita and I talked!</p>

<p>But she was impenetrable, mysterious.
She seemed to love me; possibly I really
loved her. To-day I do not know what
to think. To all my pleadings she
answered merely, “Later.” That resolution
I could not break. I swore to leave
her and she told me to go. I threatened
her, even with my violence: it left her
unconcerned. When loaded with presents
she accepted them upon her own terms.
Nevertheless, when I entered her place,
I saw a light in her eyes that was not,
I believe, a feigned one.</p>

<p>She slept nine hours at night and had
a siesta of three hours. She did nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
else. The work of the place was her
mother’s affair. During one whole week
she refused to get up at all. Her conception
of the duties of the day was very
Spanish. But I do not know from what
country came her conception of love.
After twelve weeks of wooing I saw in
her maddening smile the same promises
and certainly the same resistance.</p>

<p>At last, one day, I took her mother
into my confidence, and confessing my
love invoked her aid. After a night and a
morning that were insupportable through
suspense, I received a four-line letter&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>If you had loved me you would have
waited. I wished to give myself to you.
You have asked that I shall be sold to
you. Never again shall you see me.</i></p>

<p class="r1">
“<span class="smcap">Conchita.</span>”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When I reached their rooms in Seville
they had left with all their belongings.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<p>Autumn and winter passed. Memory
was pitiless to me, and I felt shattered.
The months were empty. Oh, how I
loved her, God of Heaven! I thought
sometimes that she was trying me, testing
me, to be sure of me. So be it. We
met again. I was returning from the
theatre, and in the Calle Trajano I
heard her voice call my name. She was
at a window about shoulder high from the
ground, in night attire and shawled.</p>

<p>I gazed at her as one entranced. She
held her hand to me, and I covered hand
and arm with kisses. I was half insane
with love. I craved for her lips only to
get for answer, “Later.”</p>

<p>I pressed her with questions. They
had been to Madrid then to Carabanchel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
By economy with my money they had
now rented her present place. There was
enough money left to live honestly for a
month.</p>

<p>“And after that do you seriously think
I shall feel embarrassed?”</p>

<p>Then she paused.</p>

<p>“You do not understand me. I can
still work at the factory, sell bananas,
make bouquets, dance the Sevillana, can
I not, Don Mateo?”</p>

<p>Then with a sigh she leant forward, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mateo, I will be your mistress the day
after to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Are you sincere?”</p>

<p>“I have said it. Leave me, Mateo.
Be not impatient or jealous.” Then she
left me.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>


<p>Two interminable days and nights
followed. I was happy and yet suffering.
A kind of troubled joy seemed to dominate
every other feeling. The hour of the
assignation came, and I heard her softly
call, “Mateo.” We kissed passionately
and a long love scene followed. Questions,
protestations, appeals. To hasten over
what was to me a time of great stress and
strain, mental and physical, let me at once
say that Concha would in reality consent
to nothing but this. I might live with her,
worship her, love her as fervently, truly,
tenderly as I liked, <em>but</em> she was to be left
wholly pure, utterly virginal. I endured
this state of things for two weeks. Concha
then borrowed from me a large sum to pay
more debts, and the next day I found that
mother and daughter had fled again!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>


<p>It was too much to bear. I left for
Madrid, and tried to get fond of an Italian
dancer. I returned to Seville, then went
to Granada, Cordova, Jérez. I sought for
Concha Perez. At Cadiz we met again.
One evening I entered a drinking saloon.
She was there dancing before sailors and
fishermen. At the moment I saw her I
trembled and throbbed. I must have
become pale, and I felt as though I had no
breath, no force, no will. I dropped down
upon the seat nearest the door, and head
in hands watched her. Her dance finished
she came towards me. All knew her.
From all sides came cries of “Conchita”
that made me shudder. On all sides she
cast glances. Here a smile, there a laugh,
a shrug, a flower accepted, a drink sipped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
She sat at my table facing me, and desired
coffee.</p>

<p>I said in a low voice that I tried to
steady&mdash;</p>

<p>“Then you fear nothing, Concha, not
even death.”</p>

<p>“You would not kill me.”</p>

<p>“Do you dare me to.”</p>

<p>“Yes, here or where you will. I know
you, Don Mateo, as though you were borne
in my bosom nine months.”</p>

<p>Bitter reproaches followed, and I taunted
her. She rose, furious, and, vowing by
her father’s tomb that she was virtuous,

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>


<p>After all that had happened I had
three paths open before me&mdash;</p>

<p>To leave her for ever;</p>

<p>To force her to stay with me;</p>

<p>To take her life.</p>

<p>I took a fourth path. I submitted to
her own way of treating me. Each evening
I returned to my cozenage, looking at
her, and waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>Little by little, I think, she was more
softened towards me. It even seemed
sometimes that she had not really intended
me the harm that had in fact been done.
But the tavern life she now made me lead
did not suit me. It never has or can.
The Señora Perez was there too.</p>

<p>She seemed to know nothing of what
had happened. Did she lie? I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
her Memoirs once more, and paid for her
glasses of Eau-de-vie.</p>

<p>My sole instants of joy were provided
by the dances of Concha. Her
triumph was the dance named <i>The Flamenco</i>.
What a tragic dance! It is, so
to speak, all passion expressed in three
acts. I always see her in that dance.
She was resplendent. During a month
she tolerated me in what may be called
the dressing-room, at the rear of the stage
where the dances took place. I had not
even the right to see her home; I kept my
“place” near her on conditions&mdash;no reproaches
as to the past or the present.
As to the future I did not know anything,
and had no idea whatever what would be
the solution of my most pitiable adventure
of body and spirit.</p>

<p>Then came a night when, with other
dancers, she danced, with bosom bared, in
a room up-stairs. There were two rich
Englishmen present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>I went up to her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Follow me. Do not be afraid. But
come or beware!”</p>

<p>But again, she dared and defied me.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>


<p>They left us alone.</p>

<p>“Defend yourself. Lie. You lie so
well!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she answered. “You accuse me.
Superb! After entering here like a thief,
spoiling my dance, and scaring every one
away.”</p>

<p>The usual scene of reproach, recrimination
and explanation followed. At the
end I drew her on to my knees.</p>

<p>“Listen,” I said. “I cannot live thus.
If you stay here a day longer I will indeed
leave you for ever, Conchita.”</p>

<p>Then she protested that she loved me,
and had always loved me.</p>

<p>Again she tamed me with her words,
and the scene ended as so many had
ended&mdash;in her triumph. We returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Seville, where I took a house for her. In
that house she pretended that she had a
lover. It was pretence, but at last I
turned and struck her in the face!</p>

<p>She tried to stab me but failed. Then
I beat her until I hurt my own hand. On
her knees she craved my pardon, and
opened her arms to me. I took her.
She was virginal as on the day of her
birth.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_PLEASURE" id="THE_NEW_PLEASURE"></a>THE NEW PLEASURE</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>For four or five years I lived in a flat
that was in a street near the little Park
Monceau. I was there only for certain
days in the week. The flat was not the
finest in Paris, but was discreet, and the
place generally had a well-valeted look.
A distinct drawback was that although
one end of my street gave on to the park,
I could not enjoy that latter place much,
for the gates were closed every evening
before midnight&mdash;just when I most deeply
appreciate walking for exercise and to
take the pure air.</p>

<p>One night at the flat I sat in silent
contemplation of two blue china cats that
crouched upon a white table. I was
wondering whether it would be better to
pass the time smoking cigarettes or writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ing
sonnets. Another idea was that it
might be better to smoke the cigarettes
and stare at the painting on the ceiling.
Cigarette, sonnet, or stare? The most
important thing at such an hour is to
have a cigarette ready to hand and lip. It
enshrouds all the most material things with
scarves of cloud, fine and celestial. It
adds something both to the lights and to
the dark of the chamber, taking away the
hard mathematics of the angles, and by
means of a scented magical spell brings to
the agitated human spirit a panacea and
peace. It brings, too, the land of dreams.
On the particular evening I now speak of
there was the intention of doing some writing,
and yet the desire to do nothing was
active and coercive. Put differently, it was
an evening that resembled many other
similar evenings of the “unlit lamp and
ungirt loin.” Evenings that ended with a
full ink-well, sheets of dead-white writing
paper, and&mdash;a large ash-tray full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
golden ends of cigarettes, ashes and unused
ideas.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was brought back from my
“open-eye dreams” by the unexpected
ringing of the bell. I raised my head and
tried to be positive that on Friday night,
the ninth of June, I did not await any one
at that hour of the night. A second ring
soon came, so I went to the door and drew
back the bolt.</p>

<p>When the door was opened I saw a
woman waiting. She was wrapped in a
sort of mantle, like a travelling cloak,
fastened around the throat. Above, the
head was poised. I saw that her hair was
blond, and that she was young. Beneath
the shadow of her tresses gleamed very
dark eyes. The face was a trifle teasing
in its expression, and rather sensual, the
mouth being very red.</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to come in?” she said,
inclining her sweet head upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>I drew back, flattened as it were against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the wall, suffering from the genuine, the
natural astonishment of a man who has to
open his door at such an hour to a woman
of whom he has not the slightest recollection&mdash;a
woman, too, who used the intimate
form of address, “thou,” in the first phrase
she used.</p>

<p>“My dear lady,” I said, with a touch of
timidity, as I followed her into my
chamber, “spare me any blame. Of
course I recognize you clearly, but by some
lapse of memory I do not recall your
name. Is it not Lucienne or Tototte?”</p>

<p>She smiled a tender, indulgent smile,
but, making no reply, unfastened her
mantle.</p>

<p>Her robe was of sea-green silk, with an
iris pattern. Snared in the low-cut corsage
were beautiful breasts, that seemed as
though they longed to burst forth&mdash;a flow
of imprisoned beauty. Clasped around
each of the nude, dark arms was a golden
snake, with glittering emerald eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Around the throat of darkest cream were
two rows of pearls&mdash;pearls that had meant
the loss of many lives.</p>

<p>“If you remember me it is because we
have met in the land of dreams, or in some
land of the mind, where it seems that
dreams come true. I am Callisto, daughter
of Lamia. During eighteen hundred years
my tomb has had peace. It is in the
flowerful fields and woods of Daphne,
near to the hills where were the voluptuous
dwelling-places of Antioch. But in
these days even the tombs have no abiding
home. They took me to Paris, and my
shadow or spirit followed. For a long
time I slept in the icy caves of the Louvre.
I should have been there for ever and ever
if it had not been for a great and grand
pagan, a really holy man, Louis Ménard.
He is the only living man in all this land
who knows to-day the signs and symbols
of the ancient divinities. Before my tomb
he solemnly pronounced the words that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
old gave a nightly and transitory life to the
unhappy dead! Therefore behold me.
For seven hours each night I may go
through your miserable city....”</p>

<p>“Oh, child of the older world,” I cried,
“how you must see the change the world
sorrows under!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and yet no. I find the dwellings
dark, the dresses ugly, the sky sorrowful.
How oddly you dress for such a climate.
I find that life in general is more stupid,
and that human beings look much less
happy than in the older and more golden
days. But if there is one thing that greatly
stupefies me, it is to see that you have still
so many of the things that I knew of old.
What ... in eighteen hundred years
have you all made nothing more, nothing
new? Is that so really and truly? What
I have seen in the houses, the open air, the
streets, is that all? Have you not succeeded
in finding a new thing? If not,
what misery, my friend!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>My attitude of astonishment was my sole
reply.</p>

<p>She smiled, the lovely red lips parting
over her mother-of-pearl teeth most enchantingly.
Then she murmured in explanation&mdash;</p>

<p>“See how I am dressed. This was my
burial attire. Regard it. In my first lifetime
one dressed in wool and silk. In
returning to the earth I thought that such
things would have passed away even from
the memory of man. I imagined that after
so many years that the human race would
have discovered fabrics to dress in more
wonderful than a tissue of sun and silk,
more pleasurable to touch than the exquisite
tender skin of young virgins, of
rose-leaves, of downy peaches. But you
still dress or clothe yourselves in thread, in
wool, in the silk we all had of old. Then
look at my shoes of olive morocco, worked
with gold like the binding of a rare book.
Have you as lovely things for the feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
these days? And so with the gems and
jewels of these days. I knew them all,
then.”</p>

<p>“Callisto,” at last I said, “you give
these things too great an importance. A
girl is never so beautiful as when she is
made as the gods made her.”</p>

<p>She gazed at me, then said very slowly,
“Are you sure now that women themselves,
their form, has not changed since
my early days of life?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>To my utter amazement she followed
her last words by slipping off her jewels
and robes. She had the grandeur of a
goddess from throat to feet. She curved
into a long, deep, easy chair, and said,
“Why have you people of to-day not perfected
the woman as you have perfected
flowers?” She continued in a soft, dreamy
voice, “Oh, days of the youth of the
world, days of the first coming of pleasure!...
During the nineteen hundred
years of my sleep in the grave what new
joy have you all discovered. What new
pleasure have you found? Invite me to
share it with you....”</p>

<p>“We need more time, Callisto,” I
pleaded.</p>

<p>She smiled in derision. “Your art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and thought have both borrowed from us&mdash;parasites
of our dead bodies. Descartes
and Kant borrowed from our Parmenides.
Euclid, Archimedes, Aristotle, Democritus,
Heraclitus ... you have discovered
nothing that they had not dreamt.
You have discovered nothing, not even
America. Aristotle said the earth was
round, and indicated the path that Columbus
finally took. But, oh! if only you
had discovered <em>one</em> new pleasure; only
one.”</p>

<p>I sighed. I could not combat her arguments
any more than I could resist her
beauty. Instead, I simply said, “Will you
take a cigarette? Doubtless Aristotle
taught you that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No,” Callisto answered; “but do you
offer me that as a new pleasure?”</p>

<p>She consented to take one, and I taught
her the best method of getting joy from
those tubes of white and gold. There followed
a long silence. She held in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
hand my packet of cigarettes, and seemed
to be deep in the enjoyment of an emotion
she would not share. Another cigarette
was lit for her, and slowly smoked. Callisto,
at last, had found a new pleasure!</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Amaryllis told to the three young women

<p>“Travellers I have known, who have
gone to Caril by ascending the Méandre
far beyond the range of the shepherds,
have seen the River God asleep in the
shade on the river-bank. He had a long
green beard, and his face was wrinkled
like the river’s grey and rocky banks from
which trailed dripping plants. His old
eyelids seemed dead as they overhung
the eyes which were for ever blind. It is
likely that if any one went to find him
now, he would not be discovered alive.</p>

<p>“Now this was the father of Byblis by
his marriage with the nymph Cyanée; I
will tell you the story of the unhappy
Byblis.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>


</div><div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>In the grotto from which the river
emerged in a mysterious way the nymph
Cyanée gave birth to twins; one was a
son who was named Caunos, and the other
a girl to whom the name of Byblis was
given.</p>

<p>They both grew up upon the banks
of the Méandre, and sometimes Cyanée
showed them beneath its transparent surface
the divine appearance of their father,
whose soul disturbed its flowing stream.</p>

<p>The only world the children knew was
the forest in which they were born. They
had never seen the sun except through the
network of its branches. Byblis never left
her brother, and walked with her arm
around his neck.</p>

<p>She wore a little tunic which her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
had woven for her in the depths of the
river, which tunic was blue-grey like
the first light of dawn. Caunos wore
around his waist nothing but a garland of
roses from which hung a yellow waist-cloth.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough for them
to walk in the woods, they wandered far
away, playing with the fruits which had
fallen to the ground, or searching for the
largest and most sweetly-scented flowers.
They always shared their finds and never
quarrelled, so that their mother spoke
proudly of them to the other nymphs her
friends.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now when twelve years from the day
of their birth had sped, their mother became
uneasy and sometimes followed
them.</p>

<p>The two children played no longer, and
when they returned from a day in the
forest, they brought back nothing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
them, neither birds, flowers, fruits, nor garlands.
They walked so close together that
their hair was mingled. Byblis’ hands
strayed about her brother’s arms. Sometimes
she kissed him upon the cheek:
then they both remained silent.</p>

<p>When the heat was too great they glided
beneath the low branches, and lying on
their breasts upon the sweet-smelling grass
talked and adored each other without
ever withdrawing from each other’s embrace.</p>

<p>Then Cyanée took her son aside and
said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why are you sad?”</p>

<p>Caunos replied&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am not sad. I used to be when I was
playing and laughing. Now everything is
changed. I no longer feel the need of
play, and if I do not laugh it is because I
am happy.”</p>

<p>Then Cyanée asked him, “Why are you
happy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer which Caunos gave her
was&mdash;</p>

<p>“Because I look at Byblis.”</p>

<p>Cyanée asked him too&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why is it that you do not now look at
the forest?”</p>

<p>“Because Byblis’ hair is softer and
more scented than the grass; because
Byblis’ eyes&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Cyanée stopped him. “Child! be
silent!”</p>

<p>Hoping to cure him of his illicit passion,
she at once took him to a mountain-nymph
who had seven daughters most wondrously
and indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p>Both of them, after planning together,
said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>“Make your choice, Caunos, and the
one who pleases you shall be your wife.”</p>

<p>But Caunos looked at the seven young
girls as unmovedly as if he had been
looking at seven rocks; for the image
of Byblis quite filled his little soul, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
there was not room in him for an alien
love.</p>

<p>For a month Cyanée took her son from
mountain to mountain, and from plain to
plain without succeeding in diverting him
from his desire.</p>

<p>At last realizing that she would never
overcome his obstinate passion, she began
to hate her son and accuse him of infamous
conduct. But the child did not
understand why his mother reproached
him. Why among all women was he to be
refused the one he loved? Why was it that
caresses, which would have been permissible
in the importunate arms of another,
became criminal in the arms of his beloved
Byblis? For what mysterious reason was
it that a sentiment which he knew to be
good, tender and capable of any sacrifice,
was deemed worthy of every punishment?
Zeus, he thought, married his sister, and
Aphrodite dared to deceive her brother
Ares with her brother Hephaïstos. For he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
did not yet know that the gods alone have
given themselves an intelligent morality
and that they disturb men’s virtue by incomprehensible
laws.</p>

<p>Now Cyanée said to her son&mdash;</p>

<p>“I disown you as my child!”</p>

<p>She made a sign to a Centaur which was
going towards the sea, and had Caunos
placed upon its back. Then the beast
went rapidly away.</p>

<p>For some time Cyanée followed her son
with her eyes. Caunos in his fright clung
to the shoulders of the beast, and was
sometimes buried in its monstrous mane.
Then Centaur moved with long and powerful
strides; it travelled in a straight line,
and soon grew small in the distance. Then
it turned behind a clump of bushes, and
reappeared looking from afar like a tiny
and almost stationary speck. At last
Cyanée could see it no longer.</p>

<p>Slowly the mother of Byblis retraced
her steps into the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>She was sad, but at the same time proud
of saving by a forced separation the
destiny of her two children; and she
thanked the gods for giving her the
strength to accomplish such a heartrending
duty.</p>

<p>“Now,” she thought, “Byblis being
alone will forget the brother who has been
sacrificed for her. She will fall in love
with the first man who knows how to
caress her, and from the marriage-bed will
spring, as is right, a race half human and
half divine. Blest are the immortal
gods!”</p>

<p>But when she returned to the grotto,
little Byblis had disappeared.</p>

</div><div class="chapter">
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>When Byblis found herself alone upon
the little bed of green leaves upon which
she had slept by her brother’s side every
night, she had in vain tried to sleep; but
that evening dreams came not to her.</p>

<p>She went out into the warm night. A
gentle breath of air swayed the darkness
of the forest. She sat down and watched
the flowing stream.</p>

<p>“Why,” she thought, “has not Caunos
come back. What has called him away
and kept him from me. Who is it, father,
that is separating us?”</p>

<p>As this last idea came to her she leant
over the spring.</p>

<p>“Father!” she repeated, “father!
where is Caunos? Reveal the secret to
me?”</p>

<p>A murmur of the water answered&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Far away.”</p>

<p>Byblis in affright quickly continued&mdash;</p>

<p>“When will he return? When will he
come back to me?”</p>

<p>“Never,” the spring replied.</p>

<p>“Dead! Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where shall I see him again?”</p>

<p>The spring spake no more. Its gentle
ripple resumed its monotonous sound. No
divine presence seemed to live in its clear
waters.</p>

<p>Byblis got up and fled. She knew the
path by which Caunos had started with his
mother. It was a narrow track which
wound from tree to tree as it buried itself
in the forest. She had not traversed it
often, for it ran through a valley infested
with serpents and dangerous beasts. This
time her desire overcame her fear, and she
tremblingly followed the path with all the
speed of which her little bare feet were
capable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was not very dark; but the
shadows thrown by the moon are black,
and behind the mighty trees Byblis had to
feel her way.</p>

<p>She reached a spot where the pathway
split in two. Which direction was she to
take, which path was she to follow? On
her knees she for a long time sought for a
footstep to guide her. But the earth was
dry. Byblis could see nothing. As she
lifted her head she perceived that, hidden
in the foliage of an oak, a tree-nymph with
green breasts was watching her with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Byblis cried, “which way did
they go? Tell me if you saw them.”</p>

<p>The tree-nymph extended one of her
long branch-like arms to the right, and
Byblis thanked her with a grateful glance.</p>

<p>She walked on that night for a long way.
The pathway seemed never-ending, and,
besides, it was hardly visible beneath a
covering of dead leaves; it ceaselessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
wound its way, determined in its direction
by the chance of the soil, and the position
of the trees; it seemed to climb up and
descend into the shadows for ever.</p>

<p>At last worn out with fatigue Byblis fell
to the ground and went to sleep.</p>

<p>She awakened in the morning when the
sun was high in the heavens with a soft,
warm sensation upon her outstretched
hand. She opened her eyes to see a white
hind gently licking her. But at Byblis’
first movement the graceful animal jumped
up, pricked its ears, and fixed its lovely
dark eyes, which glittered like a mountain
stream, upon a distant point.</p>

<p>“Hind,” Byblis said, “to whom do you
belong? If your mistress is the Goddess
Artemis guide me, for I know her. I offer
up to her in the full moonlight libations of
goat’s milk which are very pleasing to her,
and, hind, she loves me dearly. If you
are one of her company listen to the voice
of my anguish, and be sure that by so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
doing you will not displease the kind
Huntress of the Night.”</p>

<p>The hind appeared to understand; it
started off at a pace slow enough for the
child to follow. In this way they both
traversed a vast expanse of forest and
crossed two streams, the hind crossing
them with a bound while Byblis had to
wade knee-deep across them. Byblis was
full of confidence. She was now sure that
she was upon the right track; without a
doubt the hind had been sent by the
goddess herself out of gratitude for her
devoutness, and the divine animal was
leading her through the woods to her beloved
brother from whom she would never
again be separated. Every step took her
nearer to the place where she would see
Caunos again. She could even now feel
upon her breast the fugitive’s affectionate
embrace. A part of his breath seemed to
have entered into the atmosphere and to
have charmed the breeze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the hind stopped. She slid
her long head between two young trees,
where at the same time the horns of a stag
appeared, and just as if she had reached
the end of her journey the hind lay down
with her hoofs beneath her and her head
upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Caunos!” Byblis called aloud,
“Caunos, where are you?”</p>

<p>Her only answer was from the stag, as
he took a few steps towards her and threatened
her with his terrible horns, which were
interwoven like ten brown serpents.</p>

<p>Then Byblis understood that the hind,
like her, had come to meet her lover, and
that it was perhaps useless to reckon upon
the help of these entirely absorbed by an
inward passion.</p>

<p>She turned back, but she was lost. She
took another track, which rapidly descended
to an invisible path. Her poor
little weary feet stumbled over the stones,
caught in the roots, and slipped upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
brown carpet of pine-needles. At a turn
in this uneven path, which followed the
course of a stream, she stopped before a
divine couple.</p>

<p>They were two nymphs of different
orders, one of them having authority over
the forests and the other the spring waters.
The oread had brought to the naiad
the fresh offerings received from men,
and both of them were bathing in the
stream, sporting and embracing as they
did so.</p>

<p>“Naiad,” Byblis said, “have you seen
the son of Cyanée?”</p>

<p>“Yes. His shadow has passed over me.
It was yesterday at sunset.”</p>

<p>“From what direction did he come?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Where was he going?”</p>

<p>“I did not follow him.”</p>

<p>Byblis uttered a profound sigh.</p>

<p>“Did you,” she asked the other nymph,
“see the son of Cyanée?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Far away from here in the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Whence did he come?”</p>

<p>“I did not follow him.”</p>

<p>“Where was he going?”</p>

<p>“I have forgotten.”</p>

<p>Then she continued, rising up in the
midst of the flowing waters as she spake&mdash;</p>

<p>“Remain with us, young girl, stay. Why
do you still think of him, who is absent?
We have treasured up for you boundless
present joys. There is no future happiness
worth the trouble of pursuit.”</p>

<p>But Byblis did not think that the nymph
had spoken the truth. Although she was
unable to express the ideas of her little
soul, she could not conceive any greater
joy than to suffer in the pursuit of happiness.
During the first day of her useless
journey she had counted on the assistance
and zeal of the unknown creatures. When
she saw that they were careless about
aiding her destiny she relied solely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
herself, and, leaving the winding path,
penetrated haphazard into the labyrinth of
the woods.</p>

<p>But the two immortals repeated their
words of wisdom.</p>

<p>“Stay with us, young girl, stay. Why do
you still think of the absent one? There
is no future happiness worth the trouble of
pursuit.”</p>

<p>Long, long afterwards the child as she
crossed the mysterious mountain could
hear in the distance two clear voices, calling
together&mdash;</p>

<p>“Byblis!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>For a night and day Byblis traversed
the mountain. She made anxious inquiries
of all the deities of the woods, of the trees,
of the glades and the thickets. She recounted
her sorrows many times; she tremblingly
implored their assistance, and
wrung her little hands. But not one of
them had seen Caunos.</p>

<p>She climbed up so high that her
mother’s holy name was quite unknown to
all she met, and the unconcerned nymphs
did not understand her.</p>

<p>She wanted to retrace her steps, but she
was lost. On every side she was surrounded
by a confused colonnade of
enormous pine-trees. There were no more
paths. There was no horizon. She ran in
every direction. She called out in despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not even an echo to be
heard.</p>

<p>Then as her weary eyelids drooped
lower and lower she lay down upon the
ground and a passing dream told her in
measured tones&mdash;</p>

<p>“You will never see your brother, you
will never set eyes upon him again.”</p>

<p>She awoke with a start, with her arms
outstretched and her mouth open, but she
was so overwhelmed with sorrow and
anguish that she had not the strength to
cry out.</p>

<p>The moon rose red like blood behind
the high black outlines of the pine-trees.
Byblis could hardly see it. It seemed to
her that a humid veil had been dropped
over her long eyes. An eternal silence had
enveloped the sleeping woods.</p>

<p>Then a large tear gathered in the corner
of her left eye.</p>

<p>Byblis had never before wept. She
believed that she was about to die, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sighed as if divine solace had come to her
aid in a mysterious way.</p>

<p>The tear grew, trembled, became larger
still and then suddenly trickled down her
cheek.</p>

<p>Byblis remained motionless with fixed
eyes in the light of the moon.</p>

<p>Then a large tear filled the corner of her
right eye. It grew like the other and
trickled down her right cheek.</p>

<p>Two other tears came, two burning
drops which flowed down the moist track
made by the other. They reached the
corner of her mouth; a delightful bitterness
overcame the worn-out child.</p>

<p>Then never more would her hand touch
the beloved hand of Caunos. Never more
would she see the gleam of his black eyes,
his dear head, and wavy hair. Never
again would they sleep side by side in each
other’s arms upon the same bed of leaves.
The forests no longer knew his name.</p>

<p>An overwhelming outburst of despair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
made Byblis hide her face in her hands,
but such an abundance of tears moistened
her inflamed cheeks that she seemed to
feel a miraculous spring washing away her
sufferings like dead leaves upon the waters
of a torrent.</p>

<p>The tears which had been gradually
born in her, rose to her eyes, welled up,
overflowed, trickled in a warm flood over
her cheeks, bathed her tiny breasts and
fell upon her entwined legs. She did not
feel them trickle one by one between her
long lashes: they were a gentle and never-ending
stream, an inexhaustible flood, the
outpouring of an enchanted sea.</p>

<p>But awakened by the moonlight the
deities of the forest had gathered from
every side. The bark of the trees became
transparent and allowed the faces of the
nymphs to be seen; and even the quivering
naiads left the water and the rocks and
came into the woods.</p>

<p>They all crowded around Byblis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
spoke to her, for they were frightened because
the river of the child’s tears had
traced in the earth a sinuous track which
was slowly extending towards the plain.</p>

<p>But now Byblis could hear nothing,
neither voices, footsteps, nor the night
wind. Her attitude little by little became
eternal. Her skin had assumed beneath
the deluge of tears the smooth white tint
of marble washed by the waters. The
wind would not have disturbed one of her
hairs which were as long as her arms. She
died like pure marble. A vague light still
illuminated her vision. Suddenly it went
out; but fresh tears still flowed from her
eyes.</p>

<p>In that way was Byblis changed into a
fountain.</p>

<p>There was not light enough in which

twilight, the time of the gauzy haze that

<p>Moonbeams were beginning to light up
the blackest branches of trees: moonlight
and the shine of flinching silver stars.</p>

<p>There were four young Corinthians reclining
upon the ground near to three

thought, but opened their eyes wide when
the grave Melandryon said these words&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will tell you the story of the Swan

banks of the Eurotas. It is a story in
praise of blissful shadows.” He half
raised himself, and what he told his companions

</div><div class="chapter">

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>In those days there were no tombs by
the roadside and no temples upon the hills.
Men themselves scarce existed; there was
not much talk of them. The earth was
given up to the joy of the gods and the
times favoured the birth of amazing
divinities. It was the time of Echnida and
the Chimera of Pasiphæ and the Minotaur.
The young ones that there were
went pale through the woods fearing to be
waylaid by dragons. Nevertheless upon
the humid banks of the river Eurotas,
where the trees were so thick that one
could not see the light, there lived an
extraordinary young girl who was blue-tinted
like the light of the night, mysterious
as the moon and sweet as the Milky
Way. That was why they had named her
Lêda. She was in truth almost blue, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the blood of the iris was in her veins and
not the blood of the rose that is in your
own veins. Her lips shone with blue like
her eyes. Her hair was so abundant that
she sometimes seemed to have long wings.
She loved only the water and the night.
Her chief pleasure was to walk upon the
soft springy spongy turf of the banks near
the water. She could feel the cold moisture
of the water but hardly see the water itself,
and her naked feet had little shudders of
pleasure and were softly moistened.</p>

<p>For she did not bathe in the river because
of her fear of the jealous water-nymphs,
and she did not want to give herself
up to the water entirely. But she
loved to moisten her body and hair with
the sweet river-water. Sometimes she took
up into her hands the freshness of the
flood and poured it between her young
breasts, watching it trickle down and run
away. Sometimes she laid her full length
down upon the bank and drank from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
surface of the water slowly, sweetly.
Then she seemed like a thirsty little
animal. Such was chiefly her life: that
and thinking upon the satyrs. Sometimes
one came upon her unexpectedly but fled
in affright, for they all thought her to be
Phœbe, and austere to those who saw her
naked. She would have liked to talk to
them had they stayed near her. Their
appearance filled her with astonishment.
One night when she had gone for a short
walk in the forest, because it had been
raining and the ground was like a torrent,
she approached one of these half-divine
creatures as he slept and gazed upon him;
but she, too, in her turn became horrified
and quickly retraced her steps. Since that
time she occasionally thought of the incident
and was disturbed about things she
did not understand. She began to gaze at
herself and found herself mysterious. It
was the time when she became sentimental
and spent much time in weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>When the nights were clear she gazed
at her reflection in the water. Once the
thought came to her that it would be better
for her to plait her hair like a serpent and
so display the nape of her neck which the
touch of her hand told her was beautiful.
She chose a jewel for her hair and made
herself a garland of the leaves of water-lilies
and their blossoms.</p>

<p>At first she took pleasure in walking like
this. But as she was alone there was none
to gaze at her. Then she became unhappy
and ceased to be amused.</p>

<p>Now her spirit did not know itself but
her body awaited the beating of the
Swan’s wings.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>One evening, as she was hardly awake
and thought of continuing her dream, because
a long streak of yellow daylight still
flowed behind the darkness of the forest,
her attention was attracted by the sound of
the reeds near her and she saw the apparition
of a Swan.</p>

<p>The beautiful bird was as white as a
woman, splendid as the light and gleaming
like a cloud. It seemed to be like a midday
sky, its form and its winged spirit.
That is why it was called Dzeus.</p>

<p>Lêda knew it to be looking at her as it
flew and walked in turn. It circled around
the nymph at a distance and looked sidelong
at her. Even when it was almost
touching her it still continued to approach,
and rising on its red feet it stretched its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
graceful and undulating neck as high as
possible before her young thighs.</p>

<p>Lêda’s astonished hands carefully
grasped its little head and caressed it.
The bird fluttered all its feathers, with its
soft and feathery wings it gripped her
naked legs and bent them; Lêda let herself
fall upon the ground.</p>

<p>She covered her face with her two
hands. She experienced neither fear nor
shame but inexpressible joy and a beating
of the heart which made her breasts
tremble.</p>

<p>She did not realize or understand what
was about to happen. She did not even
understand why she was happy. She felt
along her arms the supple neck of the
Swan.</p>

<p>Why had it come? What had she done
that it should come to her? Why had it
not flown away like the other swans on the
river or fled like the satyrs into the forest?
From her earliest recollection she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
always lived alone. For that reason her
ideas were very limited and the events of
that night were so disconcerting. This
Swan she had neither called nor seen, for
she was asleep. It had come.</p>

<p>She neither dared to look nor move lest
it should fly away. She felt upon her
flushed cheeks the freshness of the beating
of its wings.</p>

<p>Soon it seemed to recoil and its caresses
changed. She felt between her cool
knees the warmth of the bird’s body.</p>

<p>She uttered a long sigh of bounteous
delight, let fall backward with closed eyes
her fevered head, and plucked the grass
with convulsive fingers.</p>

<p>Then for a long while she remained
motionless. At her first gesture her hand
met the Swan’s beak. She sat up and saw
the reflection of the great bird in the river.
She wished to rise but the bird prevented
her.</p>

<p>She wished to take a little water in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
palm of her hand and moisten her flesh,
but the Swan prevented her with its wing.</p>

<p>She clasped the bird in her arms and
covered its thick feathers with kisses,
making it set them up with her embraces.
Then she stretched herself upon the river-bank
and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak a new
sensation awakened her with a start: something
seemed to become detached from her
body. A large blue egg rolled in front of
her and shone like a sapphire.</p>

<p>She wanted to take it and play with it
or else cook it in the warm ashes as she
had seen the satyrs do; but the Swan picked
it up in its beak and placed it under a tuft
of overhanging reeds. It stretched out its
wings over the egg with its gaze fixed upon
Lêda, and then with a movement of the
wings slowly soared straight up into the
sky to disappear in the growing daylight
with the last white star.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>Lêda hoped that the following night the
Swan would come back to her, and she
waited for it in the reeds by the river-side
near the blue egg which was born of their
miraculous union.</p>

<p>The Eurotas was covered with swans,
but her Swan was not among them. She
would have recognized it from a thousand,
and even with her eyes shut would have
perceived its approach. But it was very
certain that the one was no longer there.</p>

<p>Then she took off her garland of water-lily
leaves, dropped it into the stream, let
down her hair and began to weep.</p>

<p>When after a time she dried her eyes a
great Satyr was near her though she had
not heard his approach.</p>

<p>Now she was no longer like Phœbe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
She had lost her virginity. The satyrs
were no longer afraid of her.</p>

<p>She leapt to her feet and drew back in
affright.</p>

<p>The Satyr gently said to her: “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>“I am Lêda,” she replied.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment and then
went on&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why are you different from the other
nymphs? Why are you blue like the water
and the night?”</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in great astonishment.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here all alone?”</p>

<p>“I am waiting for the Swan.”</p>

<p>She was looking at the river. “What
Swan?” he asked.</p>

<p>“The Swan. I did not call it, I did not
see it, but it appeared. I was so surprised.
I will tell you.”</p>

<p>She told him what had happened and
parted the reeds to show him the blue egg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The Satyr understood. He began to
laugh and gave her vulgar explanations,
which she stopped by putting her hand
over his mouth; then she cried&mdash;</p>

<p>“I do not wish to know. I will not
know. Oh, you have told me. Oh! it is
frightful! Now I shall not be able to love
the Swan, and I shall die of unhappiness.”</p>

<p>He seized her by the arm in his passion.</p>

<p>“Do not touch me!” she cried through
her tears. “Oh! how happy was I this
morning! I did not realize how happy I
was! Now if it return I shall not love it.
Now you have told me! Ah! how wicked
you are!”</p>

<p>He embraced her and caressed her hair.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no! no!” she cried. “Do not
do that! Oh if the Swan were to come
back! Alas! alas! all is ended.”</p>

<p>She stood with staring eyes and open
mouth without weeping but with hands
trembling with fear.</p>

<p>“I would like to die. I do not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
know whether I am mortal. I would like
to die in the water, but I fear the naiads,
lest they make me join them. Oh! what
have I done!”</p>

<p>She sobbed bitterly in his arms. But a
serious voice spake before her, and when
she opened her eyes she saw the river
god crowned with green leaves rising half
out of the water and leaning upon a staff
of light wood.</p>

<p>He said&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are quite right. But you have
loved the symbol of all that is light and
glorious, and you have been united to it.</p>

<p>“Of the symbol is born the symbol, and
of the symbol will be born Beauty. It is
in the blue egg which you have seen.
Since the beginning of the world it has
been called Helen; and the last man of
all shall know of her existence.</p>

<p>“You were full of love because you
were ignorant. For that let the blessed
darkness be praised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you are a woman, too, and bear in
you the obscure being who would be simply
himself, whose father has not foreseen him,
and whose son does not know him. I will
take the germ in my waters. It shall remain
in obscurity.</p>

<p>“You were full of hatred because you
learned the truth. I will make you forget
it. For that let the blessed darkness be
praised.”</p>

<p>She did not understand what the God
had said, but she thanked him with
tears.</p>

<p>She entered the bed of the river to
purify herself from the Satyr, and when
she returned to the bank she had lost every
remembrance of her sorrow and her joy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Melandryon spake no more. The
women were all silent. But Rhea asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“What of Kaftor and Polydeukes?
You have told us nothing of them. They
were the brothers of Helen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, that is not true, they are not interesting.
Helen alone was a child of the
Swan.”</p>

<p>“Why, too, do you say that the Swan
wounded her with its beak? That is not
in the legend, nor is it likely. Then why
do you say that Lêda was blue like water
in the night? You have a reason for saying
it.”</p>

<p>“Did you not hear the words of the
River. Symbols must never be explained.
They must not be understood. Have
faith. Ah! do not doubt. The maker of
the symbol has concealed a truth in it, but
he need not explain it or what would be
the use of the reader of symbols.</p>

<p>“One must not tear aside ceremonies, for
they only conceal the invisible. We know
that in these trees adorable nymphs are
enclosed, and yet when the wood-cutter
fells the trees they are dead. We know
that behind us are dancing satyrs and
divine nakedness but we need not turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
round, for if we do all will have disappeared.</p>

<p>“The undulating reflection of the
springs is actually the naiad. The buck
standing in the midst of the does is the
reality of the Satyr. One or other of you
all is Aphrodite in reality. But we must
not know it, we must not seek to find it
out. Such is the condition of love and
joy. Praise be to the blessed darkness
for it.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE GARDENS OF THE GODDESS</small></h3>


<p>The temple of Aphrodite-Astarte stood
outside the gates of the city in an immense
domain full of flowers and shadows, where
the waters of the Nile flowed through seven
aqueducts and maintained at all seasons a
state of wonderful fertility.</p>

<p>This forest of flowers on the sea-shore,
these deep streams, these lakes and shady
meadows had been created in the desert by
Ptolemy I. Since that time the sycamores
planted by his orders had become giants;
through the fertilizing influence of the
waters the lawns had grown into meadows;
the ponds had become enlarged into lakes;
Nature had turned a park into a country.</p>

<p>The gardens were more than a valley,
more than a country, more than a land;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
they were a complete world enclosed within
walls of stone, and ruled by a Goddess who
was the soul and centre of this universe.
All around this domain arose a circular
terrace. Its boundary was not a wall, it
was a colossal city, consisting of fourteen
hundred houses. A like number of courtesans
dwelt in this holy city and represented
in this spot alone seventy different
races.</p>

<p>These sacred houses were uniform in
design, and had upon each door the courtesan’s
name who dwelt there.</p>

<p>Upon each side of the door were two
rooms without walls upon the side next to
the gardens. The room to the right was
where the courtesan arrayed in all her
finery sat to await the arrival of her visitors.
The room on the left was at the disposal of
those who wished to pass the night in the
open air without sleeping on the grass.</p>

<p>On opening the door a passage gave
entrance to a vast courtyard paved with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
marble, the middle of which was adorned
by an oval basin. A peristyle provided
the shade around this great square of light,
and formed a zone of coolness for the entrance
to the seven rooms of the house.
At the back stood the altar which was of
red granite.</p>

<p>Every woman had brought from her own
country a little image of the Goddess, and
as it stood there upon the altar of the house
it was worshipped by each one in her
own tongue. Lakmî Ashtoreth, Venus,
Iskhtar, Freia, Mylitta, and Cypris were
some of the holy names of their Divinity
of Pleasure. Some worshipped the divinity
in the symbolical shapes of a sea
pebble, a conical stone, or a large prickly
shell. In many of the houses there was
upon a wooden stand a rough statuette
with thin arms, large breasts, and huge
thighs. They placed a myrtle branch at
the feet of the idol, strewed the altar with
rose-leaves, and burnt a grain of incense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
for each prayer which was granted. The
Goddess was the confidante of all their sorrows,
the witness of all their labours, and
the supposed cause of all their pleasure.
At the courtesan’s death the image was
placed in her fragile coffin as a guardian
of her tomb.</p>

<p>The most beautiful of these girls came
from the kingdoms of Asia. Every year
vessels bearing to Alexandria gifts from
tributaries or allies landed besides their
cargoes a hundred virgins chosen by the
priests for the service of the sacred garden.
They came from Mysia, Crete, Phrygia,
Babylon, and the banks of the Ganges,
and there were also Jewesses among them.
Some were fair of skin with impassive
faces and inflexible breasts; others were
dark as the earth after rain, and had
gold rings through their noses, and dark
hair hanging down upon their shoulders.
Some came from still more distant lands;
they were slender, quiet little creatures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
whose language no one understood and
who looked like yellow monkeys. Their
eyes were long, and their straight black
hair was grotesquely arranged. These
girls spent the whole of their lives like
lost and frightened animals. They knew
the gestures of love but declined to kiss
upon the mouth. They amused themselves
by playing childish games.</p>

<p>In a meadow apart, the fair and rosy
daughters of the North lived together
sleeping upon the grass. These were
women from Sarmatia with triple-plaited
hair, robust limbs, and square shoulders,
who made themselves garlands of the
branches of trees and wrestled among
themselves for amusement; there were
flat-nosed hairy Scythians and gigantic
Teutons who terrified the Egyptians with
their hair which was lighter than an old
man’s and their flesh which was softer than
a child’s; there were Gauls like animals,
who laughed without reason, and young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Celts with sea-green eyes, who never went
out naked.</p>

<p>The women of Iberia, too, who had
swarthy breasts, spent their days together.
They had heavy masses of hair which
was skilfully arranged and did not remove
the hairs from their bodies. Their firm
skins and strong limbs were much in
favour with the Alexandrians. They were
as often employed as dancers as taken for
mistresses.</p>

<p>In the shade of the palm-trees dwelt
the daughters of Africa, the Numidians
veiled in white, the Carthaginians clad in
black gauze, and Negresses clad in many-coloured
costumes.</p>

<p>There were fourteen hundred women.</p>

<p>When a woman once entered the sacred
garden, she never left it till the first day
of her old age came upon her. She gave
to the temple half of her gains and the
rest sufficed for her food and perfumes.</p>

<p>They were not slaves and each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
really possessed one of the Terrace
houses; but all were not equally favoured
and the more fortunate often purchased
houses near their own which the owners
sold to save themselves from growing thin
through starvation. The latter then
removed the image of their Divinity into
the park and found an altar consisting of
a flat stone, near which they took up their
abode. The poor people knew this and
sought out the women who slept in the
open air near their altars; but sometimes
they were neglected even by the poor,
and then the unfortunate girls united in
their misery, two and two, in a passionate
friendship which became almost conjugal
love, and shared their misfortunes.</p>

<p>Those without friends offered themselves
as slaves to their more fortunate
companions. They were forbidden to
have in their service more than twelve of
these poor girls, but these poor courtesans
are mentioned as having the maximum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
number which was composed of a selection
from many races.</p>

<p>If a courtesan bore a son, the child was
taken into the precincts of the temple for
the service of her divinity. When a
daughter was born she was consecrated to
the service of the Goddess. The first
day of her life her symbolical marriage
with the son of Dionysius was celebrated.
Later she entered the Didascalion, a great
school situated behind the temple where
little girls learned in seven classes the
theory and method of all the erotic arts;
the glance, the embrace, the movements
of the body, caresses and the secrets of
the kiss. The pupil chose the day of her
first experience because desire is a command
from the Goddess which must not
be disobeyed; on that day she received a
house on the Terrace; and some of these
children, though not yet nubile, were the
most popular of all.</p>

<p>The interior of the Didascalion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
seven classes, the little theatre and the
peristyle of the court were ornamented
with ninety-two frescoes which comprised
the teaching of love. They were the lifework
of a man, Cleochares of Alexandria
the natural son and disciple of Apelles,
who had furnished them on his death-bed.
Lately Queen Berenice, who was greatly
interested in this famous school and had
sent her little sisters there, had ordered
from Demetrios a series of marble groups
to complete the decoration; but only one
of them had yet been placed in position
in the infants’ school.</p>

<p>At the end of every year in the presence
of all the famous courtesans, a great
gathering took place at which there was
extraordinary emulation among the women
to win the twelve prizes offered, for they
consisted of the entry into the Cotytteion,
the greatest honour of which they ever
dreamed.</p>

<p>This last monument was wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
such mystery that to-day it is not possible
to give a detailed description of it. We
only know that it was in the shape of a
triangle the base of which was a temple
to the Goddess Cotytto, in whose name
frightful unheard-of debauchery was committed.
The two other sides of the
monument consisted of eighteen houses;
thirty-six courtesans dwelt there, and were
much sought after by wealthy lovers;
they were the Baptes of Alexandria.
Once every month, on the night of the
full moon, they met within the temple
maddened by aphrodisiacs. The oldest
of the thirty-six had to take a fatal dose
of the terrible erotogenous drug. The
certainty of her immediate death made her
try without fear all the dangerous pleasures
from which the living recoil. Her
body, which soon became covered with
sweat, was the centre and model of the
whirling orgie; in the midst of loud wailings,
cries, tears and dancing the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
naked women embraced her, mingled their
hair in her sweat, rubbed themselves upon
her burning skin and derived fresh ardour
from the interrupted spasm of this furious
agony. For three years these women
lived in this way, and at the end of thirty-six
months such was the intoxication of
their end.</p>

<p>Other but less venerated sanctuaries
had been built by the women in honour
of the other names of Aphrodite. There
was an altar consecrated to the Ouranian
Aphrodite which received the chaste vows
of sentimental courtesans; another to
Aphrodite Apostrophia, where unfortunate
love affairs were forgotten, and there were
many others. But these separate altars
were only efficacious and effective in the
case of trivial desires. They were used
day by day, and their favours were trivial
ones. The suppliants who had their
requests granted placed offerings of
flowers on them, while those who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
not satisfied spat upon them. They were
neither consecrated nor maintained by the
priests and consequently their profanation
was not punishable.</p>

<p>The discipline of the Temple was very
different.</p>

<p>The Temple, the Mighty Temple of the
Great Goddess, the most holy place in
the whole of Egypt, was a colossal edifice
336 feet in length with golden gates standing
at the top of seventeen steps at the
end of the gardens.</p>

<p>The entrance was not towards the East,
but in the direction of Paphos, that is to
say the north-west; the rays of the sun
never penetrated directly into the Sanctuary.
Eighty-six columns supported the
architraves, they were all tinted with
purple to half their height, and the upper
part of each stood out with indescribable
whiteness like the bust of a woman from
her attire.</p>

<p>Within were placed sculptured groups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
representing many famous scenes, Europa
and the Bull, Lêda and the Swan, the Siren
and the dying Glaucos, the God Pan and
a Hamadryad, and at the end of the frieze
the sculptor was depicted modelling the
Goddess Aphrodite herself.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>MYLITTA AND MELITTA</small></h3>


<p>“Purify yourself, stranger.”</p>

<p>“I shall enter pure,” Demetrios said.
With the end of her hair dipped in the
holy water the young guardian of the gate
moistened first his eyes, then his lips and
then his fingers, so that his look, the kiss
from his mouth and the caress of his hands
were all sanctified.</p>

<p>Then he advanced into the wood of
Aphrodite.</p>

<p>Through the darkening branches he
saw the sun set a dark purple which did
not dazzle the eyes. It was the evening
of the day when his meeting with Chrysis
had disturbed his life. That day he had
seen a beautiful woman upon the jetty,
and addressed himself to her. She had
declined his advances though he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Demetrios the famous sculptor, a young,
wealthy and handsome man and the
accredited lover of Queen Berenice. To
obtain her favour Chrysis, the courtesan,
had imposed upon him three almost impossible
conditions. She required him to
present to her the silver mirror of Bacchis
the famous courtesan, her friend, the ivory
comb worn by Touni the wife of the High
Priest, and last of all the necklace of
pearls from the neck of the statue of the
Goddess Aphrodite within the Holy
Temple. The first two of her demands
could be carried out possibly even without
the shedding of blood, but her third behest
would mean the committal of an act
of sacrilege punishable by death, before
which the boldest would hesitate. The
feminine soul is so transparent, that men
cannot believe it to be so. Where there
is only a straight line they obstinately seek
the complexity of an intricate path. This
was why the soul of Chrysis, in reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as clear as that of a little child, appeared
to Demetrios more mysterious than a
problem in metaphysics. When he left
her on the jetty, he returned home in a
dream unable to reply to the questions
which assailed him. What would she do
with the three gifts she had ordered him
to procure her? It was impossible for her
to wear or sell a famous stolen mirror, the
comb of a woman who had perhaps been
murdered in its acquirement, or the necklace
of pearls belonging to the Goddess.
By retaining possession of them she exposed
herself every day to a discovery
which would be fatal to her. Then why
did she ask for them? Was it to destroy
them? He knew that women did not
rejoice in secrets and that good luck only
pleased them when it was well known to
every one. Then, too, by what divination
or clairvoyance had she judged him
to be capable of accomplishing three
such extraordinary deeds?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely if he had wished, Chrysis might
have been carried off, placed in his power
and become his mistress, his wife or his
slave, as he pleased. He had too the
chance of destroying her. Revolutions in
the past had accustomed the citizens to
deaths by violence, and no one was disturbed
by the disappearance of a courtesan.
Chrysis must know him, and yet she
dared....</p>

<p>The more he thought of her the more
her strange commands seemed to please
him. How many women were her equal!
how many had presented themselves to
him in an unfavourable manner! What
did she demand? Neither love, gold, nor
jewels, but three impossible crimes! She
interested him keenly. He had offered
her all the treasures of Egypt: he realized
now that if she had accepted them she
would not have received two obols, and
he would have wearied of her even
before he had known her. Three crimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
assuredly, were an uncommon salary; but
she was worthy to receive it since she was
the woman to demand it, and he promised
himself to go on with the adventure.</p>

<p>To give himself no time to repent of
his resolutions that very day he went to
the house of Bacchis, found it empty, took
the silver mirror and fled into the gardens.
Must he at once go to the second victim
of Chrysis? Demetrios did not think so.
The wife of the High Priest Touni, who
possessed the famous ivory comb, was so
charming and so weak that he feared to
approach her without preliminary precautions.
So he turned back and walked
along the great Terrace.</p>

<p>The courtesans were outside their dwellings
like a display of flowers. There was
no less diversity in their attitudes and costumes
than in their ages, types and nationalities.
The most beautiful, according to
the tradition of Phryne, only leaving the
oval of their faces uncovered, were clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
from their hair to their heels in great robes
of fine wool. Others had adopted the
fashion of transparent robes, through
which their beauty could be distinguished
in a mysterious way, as through limpid
water one can see the patches of green
weeds at the bottom of the river. Those
whose only charm was their youth remained
naked to the waist, and displayed
the firmness of their breasts. But the
older women, knowing how much more
quickly a woman’s face grows old than
does the skin of the body, sat quite naked,
holding their breasts.</p>

<p>Demetrios passed very slowly in front
of them without allowing himself to admire
them.</p>

<p>He could never view a woman’s nakedness
without intense emotion. He could
not realize any feeling of disgust in the
presence of the dead, or of insensibility
with very young girls. That evening every
woman could have charmed him. Provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
she kept silence and did not display
any more ardour than the minimum demanded
by politeness her beauty did not
matter. He preferred, also, that she
should have a “coarse” body, for the more
his thoughts were fixed upon perfect
shapes the further away from them did
his desire depart. The trouble, which the
impression of living beauty gave to him,
was of an exclusively cerebral sensuality
which reduced to naught other excitation.
He recollected with agony that he
had remained for an hour like an old man
by the side of the most admirable woman
he had ever held in his arms. Since that
night he had learned to select less pure
mistresses.</p>

<p>“Friend,” a voice said, “do you not
know me?”</p>

<p>He turned, shook his head and went on
his way, for he never visited the same girl
twice. That was the only principle he
carried out in his visits to the gardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Clonarion!”</p>

<p>“Gnathene!”</p>

<p>“Plango!”</p>

<p>“Mnaïs!”</p>

<p>“Crobyle!”</p>

<p>“Iœsa!”</p>

<p>They called out their names as he
passed, and some added, as a further inducement,
a phrase upon their own ardent
nature. Demetrios continued his walk;
he was inclined, as his usual custom was,
to pick out one of them haphazard, when
a little girl dressed in blue spoke to him
softly.</p>

<p>“Open the door for me,” he said. “I
wish to speak to you.”</p>

<p>The little girl jumped gaily to her feet
and knocked twice with the knocker. An
old slave opened the door.</p>

<p>“Gorgo,” the girl said, “bring some
wine and cakes.”</p>

<p>She led the way into her chamber, which
was very plain, like that of all very young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
courtesans. Two large beds, a little
tapestry and a few chairs comprised the
furniture, but through a large open bay
could be seen the gardens, the sea, and the
roadstead of Alexandria. Demetrios remained
standing looking at the distant city.</p>

<p>The sun sinking behind the harbour,
that incomparable glory of a coast town,
the calm sky, the purple waters, were they
not enough to bring silence to any soul
bursting with joy or sorrow! What footsteps
would they not stay, what pleasure
suspend and what voice they not hush?
Demetrios watched: a swell of torrent-like
flame seemed to leap out from the sun
which had half sunk into the sea and to
flow straight to the curved edge of the
wood of Aphrodite. From one to another
of the two horizons the rich purple tone
overran the Mediterranean in zones of
shades without transition from golden red
to pale purple. Between the moving splendour
and the green mirror of the Mareotis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
lake the white mass of the city was clothed
in reddish violet reflections. The different
aspects of its twenty thousand flat houses
marvellously speckled it with twenty thousand
patches of colour perpetually changing
with the decreasing phasis of the rays
in the west. Now it was rapid and fiery;
then the sun was engulfed with almost
startling suddenness and the first approach
of the night caused a tremor throughout
the earth and a hidden breeze.</p>

<p>“Here are figs, sweets, honey and
wine. You must eat the figs before it is
dark.”</p>

<p>The girl came in with a laugh. She
made the young man sit down and took up
her position upon his knees, refastening,
as she did so, a rose in her hair which was
in danger of falling out.</p>

<p>Demetrios uttered an exclamation of
surprise, she looked so young and childish
that he felt full of pity for her.</p>

<p>“But you are not a woman!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am not a woman! By the two
Goddesses what am I then? a Thracian, a
porter or an old philosopher?”</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Ten years and a half. Eleven years.
You can say eleven. I was born in the
gardens. My mother is a Milesian, her
name is Pythias, nicknamed the ’Goat.’
Shall I send for her if you think I am too
young? She has a soft skin and is very
beautiful.”</p>

<p>“You have been to the Didascalion?”</p>

<p>“I am still there in the sixth class. I
shall finish there next year; it will not be
any too soon.”</p>

<p>“What don’t you like then?”</p>

<p>“Ah! if you only knew how hard to
please the mistresses are. They make
you begin the same lesson twenty-five
times, and it is all about useless things
which the men never desire. Then one
tires oneself for nothing, and I do not like
that. Come, have a fig; not that one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
it is not ripe. I will show you a new way
to eat them&mdash;look.”</p>

<p>“I know it. It takes longer, but it is
not a better way. I believe you are a
good pupil.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what I know I have learned by
myself. The mistresses try to make out
they are stronger than we are. They are
more experienced, but they have not invented
anything.”</p>

<p>“Have you many lovers?”</p>

<p>“They are all too old; it is inevitable.
The young are so foolish! They only
care for women of forty. I sometimes
see one pass as good-looking as Eros, and
you ought to see the woman he picks out&mdash;a
hateful hippopotamus! It makes one
turn pale. I hope I shall not live to be
the age of those women; I should be
ashamed to undress. That is why I am
so glad that I am young. But let me kiss
you. I like you very much.”</p>

<p>Here the conversation took a turn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Demetrios soon saw that his scruples were
unnecessary in the case of such a well-informed
young woman.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked her
presently.</p>

<p>“Melitta. Did you not see the name
over the door?”</p>

<p>“I did not look at it.”</p>

<p>“You could see it in the room. It has
been written on the walls. I shall soon
have to have them repainted.”</p>

<p>Demetrios raised his head. The four
walls of the room were covered with inscriptions.</p>

<p>“Well, that is very curious,” he said.
“May I read them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like. I have no secrets.”</p>

<p>He read them. The name of Melitta
was there several times, coupled with
various men’s names and strange designs.
There were tender and comic phrases.
Lovers detailed the charms of the little
courtesan, or made jokes upon her. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
that was not very interesting; but when he
was near the end of his reading he gave a
start of surprise.</p>

<p>“What is this? What is it? Tell me.”</p>

<p>“What? Where? What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Here. This name. Who wrote that?”
His finger was pointing to the name of
Chrysis.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she replied, “I wrote that.”</p>

<p>“But who is Chrysis?”</p>

<p>“She is my great friend.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that. That is not what
I am asking you. Which Chrysis is it?
There are so many.”</p>

<p>“Mine is the most beautiful Chrysis of
Galilee.”</p>

<p>“You know her, then! Tell me about
her! Where was her home? Where does
she live? Who is her lover? Tell me all
about her.”</p>

<p>He sat down upon the bed and took the
girl upon his knees.</p>

<p>“Are you in love with her?” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>“What does it matter? Tell me what
you know about her; I am anxious to
hear.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know nothing at all about her&mdash;very
little indeed. She has been twice
to see me, and you can imagine that I did
not ask her questions about her relations.
I was too pleased to see her to waste time
in idle conversation.”</p>

<p>“What is she like?”</p>

<p>“She is like a pretty girl; what do you
want me to say? Must I name all the
parts of her body and say that they are all
beautiful? Ah! she is a real woman.”</p>

<p>“You know nothing about her, then?”
Demetrios asked.</p>

<p>“I know she comes from Galilee; that
she is nearly twenty, and lives in the Jews’
quarter, on the east of the city, near the
gardens. That is all.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me nothing of her life or
tastes?”</p>

<p>“The first night she came here she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
with her lover. Then she came by herself,
and she has promised to come and see me
again.”</p>

<p>“Do you know any other friend of hers
in the gardens?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a woman from her country&mdash;&mdash;Chimairis,
a poor woman.”</p>

<p>“Where does she live? I want to see
her.”</p>

<p>“She sleeps in the wood. She has done
so for a year. She sold her house. But
I know where her nest is, and I can take
you there if you wish. Put on my sandals
for me, please.”</p>

<p>Demetrios rapidly fastened the leather
thongs of the sandals upon Melitta’s little
feet, and they went out together.</p>

<p>They walked for some distance. The
park was immense. Here and there a
girl beneath a tree called out her name as
they passed. Melitta knew a few, whom
she embraced without stopping. As she
passed a worn altar she gathered three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
large flowers from the grass and placed
them on the stone.</p>

<p>It was not yet quite dark. The intense
light of the summer days has something
durable about it which vaguely lingers in
the dusk. The sprinkling of small stars,
hardly brighter than the sky itself, twinkled
gently, and the shadows of the branches
remained vague and indefinite.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Melitta, “here is mother.”</p>

<p>A woman clad in blue-striped muslin
was coming slowly towards them. As soon
as she saw the child she ran to her, picked
her up in her arms, and kissed her fondly
on the cheeks.</p>

<p>“My little girl! my little love, where
are you going?”</p>

<p>“I am taking some one to see Chimairis.
Are you taking a walk too?”</p>

<p>“Corinna has been confined. Have
been to her, and I dined at her bedside.”</p>

<p>“Is it a boy?”</p>

<p>“Twins, my dear; as rosy as wax dolls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
You can go and see her to-night; she will
show them to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how nice! Two little courtesans.
What are they to be called?”</p>

<p>“Pannychis&mdash;both of them, because they
were born on the eve of the festival of
Aphrodite. It is a divine omen. They will
be beautiful!”</p>

<p>She put down the child, and, turning to
Demetrios, said&mdash;</p>

<p>“What do you think of my daughter?
Have I not good cause to be proud of
her?”</p>

<p>“You can be satisfied with one another,”
he calmly replied.</p>

<p>“Kiss mother,” Melitta said.</p>

<p>He did so, and Pythias kissed him on the
mouth as they separated.</p>

<p>Demetrios went a little further still
beneath the trees, while the courtesan
turned her head to watch them. At last
they reached the spot they sought, and
Melitta said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Chimairis was squatting on her left heel
in a little turfy glade between two trees
and a bush. She had beneath her a red
rag, which was her sole remaining garment
in the daytime, and on which she lay when
the men passed. Demetrios looked at her
with growing interest. She had the feverish
look of some thin, dark women whose
tawny bodies seem to be consumed by ever-present
ardour. Her great lips, her eager
gaze, her livid eyes, gave her a double
expression&mdash;that of covetous sensuality
and exhaustion. As Chimairis had sold
everything&mdash;even her toilet instruments&mdash;her
hair was in indescribable disorder, while
the down upon her body gave her something
of the appearance of a shameless
and hairy savage.</p>

<p>Near her was a great stag, fastened to
a tree by a gold chain which had once
adorned her mistress’s breast.</p>

<p>“Chimairis,” Melitta said, “get up.
Some one wants to speak to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jewess looked, but did not move.
Demetrios approached.</p>

<p>“Do you know Chrysis?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you see her often?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me about her?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Can’t you do so?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Melitta was surprised.</p>

<p>“Speak to him,” she said. “Have confidence
in him. He loves her and wishes
her well.”</p>

<p>“I can clearly see that he loves her,”
Chimairis replied. “If he loves her he
wishes her ill. If he loves her I will not
speak.”</p>

<p>Demetrios trembled with anger, but did
not speak.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand,” the Jewess said to
him. “I will see whether I am mistaken.”</p>

<p>She took the young man’s left hand and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
turned towards the moonlight. Melitta
leant over to watch, although she did not
know how to read the mysterious lines; but
their fatality attracted her.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” Demetrios asked.</p>

<p>“I see&mdash;may I tell you what I see?
Shall you be pleased? Will you believe
me? First of all I see happiness, but that
is in the past. I see love, too, but that is
lost in blood.”</p>

<p>“Mine?”</p>

<p>“The blood of a woman. Then the
blood of another woman; and then, a little
later, your own.”</p>

<p>Demetrios shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Melitta uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“She is frightened,” Chimairis went on.
“But this concerns neither her nor me.
Events must come to pass, since we cannot
prevent them. From before your birth
your destiny was certain. Go away. I
shall say no more.”</p>

<p>She let his hand drop.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>IMMORTAL LOVE AND MORTAL DEATH</small></h3>


<p>“A woman’s blood. Afterwards the
blood of another woman. Afterwards
thine; but a little later.”</p>

<p>Demetrios repeated these words as he
walked and a vague belief in them oppressed
him with sadness. He had never
believed in oracles drawn from the bodies
of victims or from the movements of the
planets. Such affinities seemed to him
much too problematic. But the complex
lines of the hand had of themselves a
horoscopic aspect which was entirely individual
and which he regarded with uneasiness.
Thus the prediction remained in
his mind.</p>

<p>He, too, gazed at the palm of his left
hand where his life was displayed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
mysterious and ineffaceable lines. He saw
the signs without being able to understand
their meaning, and passing his hand across
his eyes he changed the subject of his
meditation.</p>

<p>Chrysis, Chrysis, Chrysis.</p>

<p>The name beat in him like a fever. To
satisfy her, to conquer her, to enclose her
in his arms, to flee away with her to Syria,
Greece, Rome or elsewhere, any place, in
fact, where he had no mistresses and she
no lovers: that was what he had to do and
to do at once!</p>

<p>Of the three presents she had demanded
one was already obtained. Two others
remained to be procured, the comb and the
necklace.</p>

<p>“First the comb,” he thought. He
hastened his steps.</p>

<p>Every evening after sunset the wife of
the High Priest sat with her back to the
forest upon a marble seat from which a
view of the sea could be obtained, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Demetrios was aware of this, for Touni,
like many others, had been enamoured of
him, and once she had told him that the
day he desired her he could take her.</p>

<p>Thither he made his way.</p>

<p>She was there; but she did not see him
approach; she was reclining with her eyes
closed and her arms outstretched.</p>

<p>She was an Egyptian. Her name was
Touni. She wore a thin tunic of bright
purple without clasps or girdle, and with
no other embroidery than two black stars
upon her breasts. The thin stuff reached
down to her knees and her little, round
feet were shod with shoes of blue leather.
Her skin was very swarthy, her lips were
very thick, her fragile and supple waist
seemed bowed down by the weight of her
full breast. She was sleeping with open
lips and quietly dreaming.</p>

<p>Demetrios took his seat in silence by her
side.</p>

<p>He gradually drew nearer to her. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>A
young shoulder, smooth and dark and
muscular, delicately offered itself to him.</p>

<p>Lower down the purple muslin tunic
was open at the thigh. Demetrios gently
touched her, but she did not awake. Her
dream changed but was not dispelled.</p>

<p>The eternal sea shimmered beneath a
moon which was like a vast cup of blood,
but still Touni slept on with bowed head.</p>

<p>The purple of the moon upon the
horizon reached her from across the sea.
Its glorious and fateful light bathed her
in a flame which seemed motionless; but
slowly the shadow withdrew from the
Egyptian woman; one by one her black
stars appeared, and at last there suddenly
emerged from the shadows the comb, the
royal comb desired by Chrysis.</p>

<p>Then the sculptor took in his two hands
Touni’s sweet face and turned it towards
him. She opened her eyes which grew
big with surprise.</p>

<p>“Demetrios! Demetrios! You!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Her two arms seized hold upon him.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she murmured in a voice vibrating
with happiness, “oh! you have come,
you are there. Is it you, Demetrios, who
has awakened me with your hands? Is it
you, son of my Goddess, O God of my
body and life?”</p>

<p>Demetrios made a movement as if to
draw back, but she at once came suddenly
quite close to him.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “what do you fear? I
am not a woman to be feared by you, one
surrounded by the omnipotence of the
High Priest. Forget my name, Demetrios.
Women in their lovers’ arms have no name.
I am not the woman you believe me to be.
I am only a creature who loves you and
is filled with desire for you.”</p>

<p>Demetrios made her no answer.</p>

<p>“Listen once more,” she went on. “I
know whom you possess. I do not desire
to be your mistress, nor do I aspire to become
my Queen’s rival. No, Demetrios,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
do with me what you will: look upon me
as a little slave whom one takes and casts
aside in a moment. Take me like one of
the lowest of those poor courtesans who
wait by the side of the pathway for furtive
and abortive love. In fact what am I but
one of them? Have the Gods given me
anything more than they have bestowed
upon the least of all my slaves? You at
least have the beauty which comes from
the Gods.”</p>

<p>Demetrios gazed at her still more
gravely.</p>

<p>“What do you think, unhappy woman,”
he asked, “also comes from the Gods?”</p>

<p>“Love.”</p>

<p>“<em>Or death.</em>”</p>

<p>She got up.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? <em>Death....</em>
Yes, death. But that is so far away from
me. In sixty years’ time I shall think of
it. Why do you speak to me of death,
Demetrios?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He simply said&mdash;</span><br />

<p>“Death to-night.”</p>

<p>She burst into a frightened laugh.</p>

<p>“This evening ... surely not ...
who says so? Why should I die?...
answer me, speak, what horrible jest is
this?...”</p>

<p>“You are condemned.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“By your destiny.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I knew it because I, too, Touni, am
involved in your destiny.”</p>

<p>“And my destiny wills that I die?”</p>

<p>“Your destiny demands that you die
by my hand upon this seat.”</p>

<p>He seized her by the wrist.</p>

<p>“Demetrios,” she sobbed in her fear,
“I will not cry out. I will not call for
help. Let me speak.”</p>

<p>She wiped the sweat from her forehead.</p>

<p>“If death comes to me through you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
death will be pleasant. I will accept it,
I desire it; but listen to me.”</p>

<p>She dragged him into the darkness of
the wood, stumbling from stone to stone.</p>

<p>“Since you have in your hands,” she
continued, “everything we receive from
the Gods, the thrill which gives life and
that which takes it away, open your two
hands upon my eyes, Demetrios ... that
of love and that of death, and if you do
so, I shall die without regret.”</p>

<p>He gazed at her without replying, but
she thought she could read assent in his
face.</p>

<p>Transfigured for the second time she
lifted up her face with a fresh expression
in it, one of new-born desire driving
away terror with the strength of desperation.</p>

<p>She said no more, but from between her
parted lips each breath seemed to be a
song of victory.</p>

<p>She seized him in her arms crying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! Kill me ... kill me, Demetrios,
why are you waiting!”</p>

<p>He rose, gazed once more at Touni as
she lifted up her great eyes to him, and
taking one of the two gold pins from her
hair, he buried it in her left breast.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>APHRODITE’S PEARLS</small></h3>


<p>Yet this woman would have given him
her comb and even her hair for love of
him.</p>

<p>It was simply a scruple which had prevented
him asking her for it: Chrysis had
very clearly desired a crime and not the
ancient ornament from a young woman’s
hair. That was the reason he believed it
his duty to take part in the shedding of
blood.</p>

<p>He might have considered that oaths
made to a woman during an access of
love can be forgotten afterwards without
any great harm being done to the moral
worth of the lover who has sworn them,
and that, if ever this involuntary forgetfulness
were excusable, it was so in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
circumstances when the life of another
woman, who was quite innocent, was being
weighed in the balance. But Demetrios
did not stay to reason thus. The adventure
he had undertaken seemed to him too
curious to be stayed by incidents of
violence.</p>

<p>So after cutting off Touni’s hair and
concealing the ivory comb in his clothing,
he without further reflection undertook
the third of the tasks ordered by Chrysis:
the taking of the necklace of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>There was no question of entering the
temple by the great door. The twelve
hermaphrodites who kept the door would
no doubt have allowed Demetrios to enter,
in spite of the order which refused admission
to the unsanctified in the priest’s
absence; but what was the use of thus
simply establishing his guilt for the future
when there was a secret entry leading to
the sanctuary. Demetrios wended his way
to a lonely part of the wood where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
necropolis of the High Priests of the Goddess
was situated. He counted the tombs,
opened the door of the seventh, and closed
it behind him.</p>

<p>With great difficulty, for the stone was
heavy, he raised a slab within the tomb
which disclosed a marble staircase and
descended it step by step.</p>

<p>He knew that it was possible to take
sixty steps in a straight line and then it
was necessary to advance by feeling the
wall to save falling down the subterranean
staircase of the temple.</p>

<p>The coolness of this deep passage
gradually calmed him. In a few minutes
he reached the end of it, ascended steps
and opened the door.</p>

<p>The night was clear in the open, but
black in the holy place. When he had
cautiously closed the heavy door, he felt
himself to be trembling as if he had been
gripped by the coldness of the stones. He
dared not lift his eyes. The black silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
terrified him; the darkness seemed to him
alive with the unknown. He put his hand
to his brow like a man who did not desire
to awaken lest he might find himself alive.
At last he had the courage to look.</p>

<p>In a gleam of bright moonlight the Goddess
was visible upon a pedestal of red
stone loaded with hanging treasures. She
was naked and tenderly tinted like a
woman; in one hand she held her mirror
and with the other she was adorning her
beauty with a necklace of seven rows of
pearls. A pearl, larger than the rest, long
and silvery, gleamed at her breast like a
crescent. These were the actual holy
pearls.</p>

<p>Demetrios was lost in ineffable adoration.
He believed in truth that Aphrodite
herself was there. He could no longer
recognize his own work, so deep was the
abyss between that which it used to be and
had become. He extended his arms and
murmured the mysterious words by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the Goddess is addressed in the Phrygian
ceremonies.</p>

<p>Supernatural, luminous, immaculate,
nude and pure the vision seemed to hover
over the stone pedestal softly palpitating.
He fixed his eyes upon it, though he feared
that the caress of his gaze would make this
feeble hallucination vanish in the air. He
advanced slowly and touched with his
finger the rosy toe as if to assure himself
of the existence of the statue, and being
incapable of stopping, so great was its
attraction for him, he mounted and stood
by its side, placing his hands upon the
white shoulders and looking into the eyes.</p>

<p>He trembled, he faltered and began to
laugh with joy. His hands wandered over
the bare arms, and he clasped the cold
hard waist with all his strength. He gazed
at himself in the mirror, grasped the necklace
of pearls, took it off, made it gleam
in the moonlight and then fearfully replaced
it. He kissed the hand, the round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
neck, the undulating throat and the
half-open marble mouth. Then he withdrew
to the edge of the pedestal and
gazed tenderly at the lovely bowed
head.</p>

<p>The hair of the statue had been arranged
in the oriental fashion and lightly veiled
the forehead. The half-shut eyes were
prolonged in a smile. The lips were
separated as if vanquished by a kiss.</p>

<p>He silently replaced the seven rows of
round pearls upon the glorious breast and
descended to gaze upon the idol from a
greater distance.</p>

<p>Then he seemed to awaken. He remembered
his errand which he had up to
then failed to accomplish, and realized
how monstrous a project it was. He felt
his blood burn to the temples.</p>

<p>The memory of Chrysis came to him like
a common apparition. He enumerated
everything which was at all doubtful in
the courtesan’s beauty; her full lips, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
dishevelled hair and her careless walk. He
had forgotten what her hands were like,
but he imagined them to be large in order
to add an odious detail to the picture which
he was attempting to reject. His state of
mind was like that of a man who had been
surprised at dawn by his dear mistress in
the arms of a common girl, and could offer
no explanation to himself as to why he
allowed himself the previous evening to be
tempted. He could find no excuse for
himself nor even a serious reason.
Evidently during the day he had suffered
from a fit of passing madness, a physical
trouble, a malady. He felt himself to be
cured but still intoxicated with stupefaction.</p>

<p>To complete the recovery of his senses
he leant against the temple wall and stood
for a long time before the statue. The
moonlight continued to shine through the
square opening in the roof; Aphrodite
shone resplendent; and as the eyes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
statue were in the shadow he tried to catch
their expression.</p>

<p>He spent the whole night like this.
Then daylight came and the statue in turn
assumed the living rose colour of the dawn
and the golden tint of the sunlight.</p>

<p>Demetrios could no longer think. The
ivory comb and the silver mirror which he
carried within his tunic had disappeared
from his memory. He gently abandoned
himself to serene contemplation.</p>

<p>Outside the confused singing and twittering
of the birds sounded in the gardens.
The talking and laughing of women’s
voices could be heard outside the walls.
The life and movement of the morning
was spreading over the awakened land.
Demetrios was full of pleasant ideas.</p>

<p>The sun was high and the shadow from
the roof had moved before he heard the
confused sound of light footsteps on the
outer staircase.</p>

<p>No doubt it was the prelude of a sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>fice
to the Goddess by a procession of
young women, who came to perform their
vows or to offer up their prayers before
the statue on the first day of the festival
of Aphrodite.</p>

<p>Demetrios wished to flee. The sacred
pedestal opened at the back in a way that
only the priests and the sculptor knew.
That was the position occupied by the hierophant
from which he recited to a young
girl with a clear strong voice the miraculous
discourse which came from the statue
on the third day of the festival. From that
place the gardens could be reached.
Demetrios entered and stood before a
bronze-edged opening which pierced the
thick stone.</p>

<p>The two golden gates slowly opened.
Then the procession entered.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>DICE&mdash;THE VENUS THROW</small></h3>


<p>About the middle of the night Chrysis
was awakened by three knocks at the door.</p>

<p>She was sleeping with her two friends
Rhodis and Myrtocleia, and rising cautiously
she went down and half opened the
door.</p>

<p>A voice came from without. “Who is
it, Djala? Who is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Naucrates wishes to speak to you. I
told him that you were engaged.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how foolish! Most certainly I
will see him. I am not engaged. Come in,
Naucrates. I am in my chamber.”</p>

<p>She went back to bed. Naucrates remained
for a moment at the door as if he
feared to be indiscreet. The two girls, who
were musicians, opened their sleepy eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
but could not rend themselves from their
dreams.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Chrysis. “There
need be no false modesty between us two.
I know that you have not come to see me.
What do you want?”</p>

<p>Naucrates was a well-known philosopher
who for more than twenty years had
been the lover of Bacchis and had not
deceived her, though more from indolence
than fidelity be it said. His grey hair was
cut short, his beard was pointed after the
manner of Demosthenes and his moustaches
were even with his lips. He wore
a great white woollen robe.</p>

<p>“I have brought you an invitation,” he
said. “Bacchis is giving a dinner to-morrow
to be followed by a fête. We shall
be seven including yourself. Be sure you
come.”</p>

<p>“A fête? What is the occasion?”</p>

<p>“She has given freedom to her most
beautiful slave Aphrodisia. There will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
dancers and musicians. I think your two
friends are engaged to be there, and ought
not to be here now. They are at this
moment rehearsing at Bacchis’ house.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is right,” Rhodis cried, “we
had forgotten it. Arise, Myrto, we are
very late.”</p>

<p>But Chrysis declared&mdash;</p>

<p>“No! not yet! It is too bad to take
away my friends. If I had suspected I
should not have admitted you. Oh! they
are dressed already!”</p>

<p>“Our dresses are not very elaborate,”
the girl answered. “We are not beautiful
enough to spend much time over our
toilettes.”</p>

<p>“Shall I then see you at the temple at
some hour to-morrow?” Chrysis asked them.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-morrow morning, we shall take
doves as our offering. I am taking a
drachma from your purse, Chrysis. We
shall not otherwise have the money to purchase
them. Good-bye till to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>They ran out. Naucrates gazed for
some time at the door which had closed
behind them, then he rose, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Can I tell Bacchis that she may reckon
upon you?”</p>

<p>“I will come,” Chrysis replied.</p>

<p>The philosopher bowed to her and
slowly departed.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone Chrysis clasped
her hands and spoke aloud although she
was alone.</p>

<p>“Bacchis, Bacchis, he comes from her
and does not know. Is the mirror then
still in her possession? Demetrios has forgotten
me. If he has hesitated on the first
day, I am lost, he will do nothing. But it
is quite possible that he has obtained it.
Bacchis has other mirrors which she uses
more often. Without a doubt she has not
found out yet. Ye Gods! Ye Gods! there
is no way of finding out. Ah! Djala!
Djala!”</p>

<p>The slave entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give me my dice. I wish to throw
them,” Chrysis said.</p>

<p>She tossed in the air the four dice.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! Djala, look!”</p>

<p>The throw had resulted in the dice each
presenting a different face. It was thirty-five
chances to one against this happening
and it was the highest scoring throw of all.</p>

<p>Djala coldly observed&mdash;</p>

<p>“What did you wish?”</p>

<p>“Quite true,” Chrysis said in disappointed
tones. “I forgot to utter a wish.
I thought of something but said nothing.
Does not that count just the same?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so; you must start
again.”</p>

<p>Chrysis made a second throw. This
time the result was not decisive, it resulted
in both good and bad omens and required
another throw to make its meaning clear.</p>

<p>The third throw Chrysis made with one
of the dice only, and when she saw the
result burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Djala said nothing but was herself
uneasy. Chrysis lay upon her bed weeping
with her hair in disorder. At last she
turned round with an angry movement.</p>

<p>“Why did you make me begin again?
I am sure the first throw counted.”</p>

<p>“It would have done if you had expressed
a wish, but you did not. You are
the only one who knows what your desire
was.”</p>

<p>“Besides, dice prove nothing. It is a
Greek game. I don’t believe in it. I am
going to try something else.”</p>

<p>She dried her tears and crossed the
room. She took from the table a box of
white counters, selected twenty-two of
them, and then with the point of a pearl
hook scratched one after the other the
letters of the Hebrew alphabet upon
them.</p>

<p>“I rely upon this. It never deceives
one,” she said. “Raise the front of your
robe, that shall be my bag.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>She threw the twenty-two counters into
the slave’s tunic, repeating in her mind&mdash;</p>

<p>“Shall I wear Aphrodite’s necklace?
Shall I wear Aphrodite’s necklace? Shall
I wear Aphrodite’s necklace?”</p>

<p>She drew out the tenth arcanum which
clearly meant&mdash;</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE ROSE OF CHRYSIS THE LOVELY</small></h3>


<p>It was a white, blue, yellow, red and
green procession.</p>

<p>Thirty courtesans advanced carrying
baskets of flowers, snow-white doves with
red feet, veils of the most fragile azure
and valuable ornaments.</p>

<p>An old white-bearded priest, enveloped
from head to foot in stiff unbleached stuff
walked in front of this procession of youth
and guided towards the stone altar the line
of devout worshippers.</p>

<p>They sang, and their song rose and fell
like the sound of the sea and the winds.
The first two carried harps, which they
held in the palm of their left hands
and bent forward like sickles of slender
wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>One of them advanced and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tryperha, beloved Cypris, offers thee
this blue veil which she has spun herself
so that thou mayst continue thy goodness
to her.”</p>

<p>Another said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mousairon lays at the feet of the Goddess
of the beautiful crown, these garlands
and bouquets of flowers. She has worn
them at the fête and has invoked thy name
in the intoxication of their perfumes. O
Conqueror, receive these spoils of love.”</p>

<p>Another one said&mdash;</p>

<p>“As an offering to thee, golden Cytheræ,
Timo consecrates this sinuous
bracelet. Mayst thou entwine thy vengeance
around the throat of the one thou
knowest, as this silver serpent entwined
itself about these naked arms.”</p>

<p>Myrtocleia and Rhodis advanced hand
in hand.</p>

<p>“Here are two doves from Smyrna with
wings as white as caresses and feet as red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
as kisses. O double Goddess of Amathonte,
accept them from our joint hands
if it is true that the fair Adonis did not
satisfy thee and a still more sweet embrace
sometimes disturbed thy slumbers.”</p>

<p>A very young courtesan followed, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Aphrodite Peribasia receive my virginity
with this stained tunic of mine.
I am Pannychis of Pharos; since last
night I have vowed myself to thy worship.”</p>

<p>Another said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dorothea begs thee, charitable Epistrophia,
to banish from her mind the desire
placed there by Eros or at least to inflame
for her the eyes of the lover who refuses
her. She presents to thee this branch
of myrtle because it is the tree thou
preferest.”</p>

<p>Another said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Upon thy altar, Paphia, Calliston
places sixty drachmas of silver, the balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of a gift she has received from Cleomenes.
Give her a still more generous lover, if the
offering seems to thee acceptable.”</p>

<p>The only one left in front of the idol
was a blushing child who had taken the
last place. She held in her hand nothing
but a tiny garland of flowers, and the priest
treated her with contempt because of the
smallness of her offering.</p>

<p>She said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am not rich enough to give thee
pieces of gold, great Goddess. Besides,
what could I give thee which thou dost not
already possess. Here are green and
yellow flowers woven as a garland for thy
feet.”</p>

<p>The procession seemed to be at an end
and the other courtesans were about to
retrace their steps when a woman was seen
standing at the door.</p>

<p>She had nothing in her hand and seemed
to have come to offer her beauty to the
Goddess. Her hair was like two waves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
gold, two deep billows full of shadow
engulfing the ears and twisted in seven
turns at the throat. Her nose was fine, with
expressive and palpitating nostrils, and
beneath it was a full and coral coloured
mouth with rounded mobile corners to it.
The supple lines of the body undulated
at each step she took.</p>

<p>Her eyes were wonderful; they were
blue but dark and gleaming as well, and
changed like moonstones, as she held them
half closed beneath her long lashes. The
glances of those eyes were like the sirens’
songs.</p>

<p>The priest turned towards her and
waited for her to speak.</p>

<p>She said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Chrysis offers up her prayer to thee, O
Chrysea. Receive the paltry offering she
lays at thy feet. Hear and aid, love
and solace her who lives according to
thy pattern and for the worship of thy
name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>She extended her hands golden with
rings and bowed her knees before the
Goddess.</p>

<p>The vague chant recommenced. The
sound of the harps ascended towards the
statue with the smoke of the incense which
the priest was burning in a swinging
censor.</p>

<p>She slowly rose and presented a bronze
mirror which had been hanging at her
girdle.</p>

<p>“To thee,” she said, “Astarte, Goddess
of the Night, who minglest hands and lips
and whose symbol is like unto the footprint
of the hinds upon the earth of Syria,
Chrysis consecrates her mirror. It has seen
the eyes and the gleam of love in them, the
hair clinging to the temples after the rites
of thy ceremonial, O thou warrior with
relentless hands thou mingler of bodies
and mouths.”</p>

<p>The priest placed the mirror at the foot
of the statue. Chrysis drew from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
golden hair a long comb of red copper, the
sacred metal of the Goddess.</p>

<p>“To thee,” she said, “Anadyomene, who
wast born of the blood-hued dawn and the
foaming smile of the sea, to thee, whose
nakedness is like the gleam of pearls, who
fastenest thy moist hair with ribbons of
seaweed, Chrysis dedicates her comb. It
has been plunged in her hair disordered
by movements in thy name.”</p>

<p>She handed the comb to the old man and
leant her head to the right to take off her
emerald necklace.</p>

<p>“To thee,” she said, “O Hetaira, who
wipest away the blushes of shamefaced
virgins and teaches them the immodest
laugh, to thee, for whom we barter our
love, Chrysis dedicates her necklace. She
received it from a man whose name she
does not know and each emerald represents
a kiss where thou hast dwelt for a
moment.”</p>

<p>She bowed herself once again and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a longer space as she placed the necklace
in the priest’s hands and took a step as if
to depart.</p>

<p>But the priest detained her.</p>

<p>“What do you ask from the Goddess in
return for these precious offerings?”</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“I ask for nothing.”</p>

<p>Then she walked along the row of
women, took a rose from a basket and
raised it to her lips as she went out.</p>

<p>One by one all the women followed her
and the door closed upon an empty temple.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Demetrios had remained alone concealed
in the bronze pedestal.</p>

<p>He had not lost a gesture or a word of
the whole of this scene, and when it was
ended he remained for a long while without
moving, being once again in a state of
torment, passion and irresolution.</p>

<p>He had believed himself cured of the
madness of the previous night and thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that nothing could ever again hurl him into
this shadow of the unknown.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without the woman.</p>

<p>Women! women! if you desire to be
loved, show yourself, return, be ever-present!
The emotion he had felt at the
entrance of the courtesan was so overwhelming
and complete that there could be
no thought of opposing it by an effort of
the will. Demetrios was bound like a barbarian
slave to the conqueror’s chariot.
The thought that he had freed himself
was a delusion. Without knowing it and
quite naturally she had placed her hand
upon him.</p>

<p>He had seen her approach, for she wore
the same yellow robe she had done when
he met her on the jetty. She walked with
slow and graceful steps with undulating
motion of the hips. She had come straight
towards him as if she guessed he were concealed
behind the stone.</p>

<p>From the first he realized that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
again fallen at her feet. When she took
from her girdle the mirror of shining
bronze, she gazed at herself in it for a time
before handing it to the priest, and the
splendour of her eyes became dazzling.
When to take her copper comb she put
her hand to her hair and lifted her bent
arm, the beautiful lines of her body were
displayed beneath her robe and the sunlight
glistened upon the tiny beads of
perspiration on her skin. When, last of
all, to unfasten and take off her necklace
of heavy emeralds she put aside the thick
silk which shielded her breast and left but
a little space full of shadow with just room
for the insertion of a bouquet, Demetrios
felt himself seized with frenzy.</p>

<p>But then she began to speak and each
word of hers was suffering to him. She,
a beautiful vase, white as the statue itself
and with gleaming golden hair, seemed to
insist upon pleasure. She told of her
deeds in the service of the Goddess. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the ease with which her favours were
obtainable attracted Demetrios to her.
How true it is that a woman is not entirely
seductive to her lover unless she gives him
ground for jealousy!</p>

<p>So, after presenting to the Goddess her
green necklace in exchange for the one
for which she was hoping, when Chrysis
returned to the city she took with her a
man’s will in her mouth with the little rose
the stalk of which she was biting.</p>

<p>Demetrios waited till he was alone in
the holy place; then he emerged from his
retreat.</p>

<p>He looked at the statue in anguish expecting
a struggle within him. But being
incapable of renewing, after so short an
interval, such violent emotion, he remained
wonderfully calm and without any preliminary
remorse.</p>

<p>He carelessly ascended to the statue,
took off the necklace of real pearls from its
bowed neck and concealed it within his
raiment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>QUEEN BERENICE</small></h3>


<p>He walked very rapidly in the hope of
overtaking Chrysis on the road leading to
the city, fearing if he lingered that he
might become cowardly and irresolute once
again.</p>

<p>The road, white with heat, was so luminous
that Demetrios closed his eyes as if
he had been in the midday sunlight. In
that way he walked without seeing where
he was going, and he had only just escaped
colliding with four black slaves who were
walking in front of a cortège when a little
musical voice softly said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Beloved! how glad I am!”</p>

<p>He lifted his head: it was Queen Berenice
reclining in her litter.</p>

<p>She ordered the bearers to stop and
stretched out her arms to her lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Demetrios was much annoyed; but he
could not refuse, so he slipped into the
litter, with a sullen air.</p>

<p>Then Queen Berenice was filled with
joy and rolled upon her cushions like a
playful cat.</p>

<p>Now this litter was a room and twenty-four
slaves carried it. Twelve women
could easily lie within amid its blue
tapestry, cushions and stuffs; and it was
so lofty that it was not possible to touch
the ceiling even with a fan. It was greater
in length than in breadth, closed in front,
but on the other three sides there were
three very light yellow curtains, through
which the light came with dazzling brightness.
The floor was of cedar-wood covered
with orange silk. Within it a lighted lamp
struggled with the daylight and its ever
changing shadows. Here Queen Berenice
reclined between two Persian slaves who
gently fanned her with fans of peacock’s
feathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>She invited the young sculptor to her
side with a look and repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>“Beloved, I am pleased.” She put her
hand upon his cheek.</p>

<p>“I was seeking you, beloved. Where
have you been? I have not seen you since
the day before yesterday. If I had not
met you I should have shortly died of
grief. Alone in this great litter I was very
dull. When passing over the bridge of
Hêrmes I threw all my jewels into the
water to make rings. You can see that I
have neither rings nor necklaces now. I
am like a little pauper at your feet.”</p>

<p>She turned to him and kissed him upon
the lips. The two fan-bearers withdrew
a little further, and when Queen Berenice
began to speak in a low voice they put
their fingers in their ears to pretend that
they were not listening.</p>

<p>But Demetrios did not reply, for he
hardly heard her and was quite deranged.
He could only see the young Queen’s smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
on her red lips, and the black cushion of
her hair which was always loosely arranged
to serve as a pillow for her weary head.</p>

<p>She said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Beloved, I have wept during the night.
My bed was cold. When I awakened, I
stretched out my naked arms on each side
of my body and I did not touch you, nor
could my hand find this hand of yours I
am now embracing. I expected you in the
morning and since the full moon you have
not come. I sent my slaves into every
quarter of the city and I condemned them
to death when they returned without you.
Where have you been? Were you at the
Temple? You were not in the gardens
with the foreign women? No, I can see
from your eyes that you were not. Then
what were you doing so long away from
me? Were you before the statue? Yes,
I am sure you were there. You love it
more now than you love me. It is very
like me, it has my eyes, my mouth, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
breasts; but that is what you seek. As for
me I am poor and forlorn. You are weary
of me and I can see it clearly. You think
of your marble and your ugly statues as
if I were not more beautiful than all of
them, as well as being alive, loving, good,
ready to give all that you will accept and
resigned to your refusals. But you will
have nothing. You would not be king,
you would not be a god and worshipped
in a temple of your own. You will hardly,
even, consent to love me now.”</p>

<p>She withdrew her feet beneath her and
leant upon her hand.</p>

<p>“I would do anything in the world to
see you at the palace, beloved. If you no
longer desire me tell me who attracts you
and she shall be my friend. The women
of my court are beautiful. I have twelve
who from their birth have been kept in
my gynæceum and are ignorant that men
exist. They shall all be your mistresses
if you come and see me after them. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I have with me who have had more lovers
than the sacred courtesans and are expert
in love. Say one word. I have, too, a
thousand foreign slaves: those you desire
shall be given to you. I will dress them
like myself, in yellow silk, gold and silver.</p>

<p>“No, you are the handsomest and
coldest of men. You love no one, you
lend yourself simply out of charity for
those whom your eyes have filled with love.
You allow me to obtain my happiness from
your presence, but only in the way a beast
allows itself to be led, looking elsewhere.
You are full of condescension. Ye Gods!
Ye Gods! I shall end by separating from
you, young coxcomb whom all the city
adores and no one can make weep. I
have others besides women at the palace.
I have strong Ethiopians who have chests
of bronze and arms knotted with muscles.
I shall soon forget you. But the day I
am sure that your absence no longer makes
me suffer, that I have replaced you, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
send you from the top of the bridge of
Hêrmes to join my necklaces and rings
like a jewel I have worn too long. Ah!
what it is to be a queen!”</p>

<p>She raised herself and seemed to be
waiting for an answer. But Demetrios
still remained impassible and made no
more movement than if he had not heard.</p>

<p>“Do you not understand?”</p>

<p>He nonchalantly leant upon his elbow
as he said in a very unconcerned way&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have just had an idea for a story.</p>

<p>“Long ago before Thrace was conquered
by your father’s ancestors it was
overrun by wild animals and a few timid
men dwelt there as well.</p>

<p>“The animals were very fine; there were
lions red as the sun, tigers streaked like
the evening and bears black as night.</p>

<p>“The men were small and flat-nosed,
clad in old hairless skins, and armed with
big spears and clumsy bows. They hid
themselves in mountain caves, behind huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
blocks of stone which they moved with the
greatest difficulty. Their life was spent in
hunting. There was blood in the forests.</p>

<p>“The land was so mournful that the
Gods had deserted it. When at the break
of day Artemis left Olympus his path was
never towards the north. The wars there
never disturbed Ares. The absence of
flutes and citharas turned away Apollo
from it. The triple Hecate shone there
alone like the face of a Medusa upon a
petrified land.</p>

<p>“Now a man came there to dwell; a
man of a more fortunate race, who did not
walk about clad in skins like the savages
in the mountains.</p>

<p>“He wore a long white robe which
trailed behind him a little. Through the
beautiful glades of the forest he loved to
wander at night in the moonlight holding
in his hand a little lute with three silver
strings.</p>

<p>“When his fingers touched the strings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
delightful music came from them, music
sweeter than the sound of the springs or
the whispers of the wind in the trees or the
noise of grass shaken by the wind. The
first time he began to play three sleeping
tigers awakened, and so charmed were they
that they did him no injury but came as
near as possible to him while he was playing
and afterwards withdrew. The next
day still more animals came to listen,
wolves, hyænas and serpents upright upon
their tails.</p>

<p>“After a very short time the animals
themselves came and asked him to play
to them. It often happened that a bear
came to him alone and went away satisfied
with three marvellous chords. In
return for his kindness the beasts gave him
his food and protected him against men.</p>

<p>“But he wearied of this fastidious life.
He became so sure of his genius and of
the pleasure he gave the beasts that he no
longer troubled to play well. The animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
were always satisfied as long as he played
to them. Soon he even refused to give
them this pleasure, and through idleness
ceased to play to them at all. The whole
of the forest was sad, but the morsels of
food and tasty fruits did not cease to be
brought to the musician’s door. They continued
to feed him and loved him all the
more. After this fashion are the hearts of
animals made.</p>

<p>“Now one day while he was leaning at
his open door and watching the sun sink
behind the motionless trees a lioness
passed near him. He made a movement
as if to go inside as if he expected a
request which would displease him. The
lioness took no notice of him and quietly
passed on.</p>

<p>“Then he asked her in surprise: ’Why
do you not ask me to play?’ She replied
that she did not care for it. He said: ’Do
you not know me?’ She replied: ’You are
Orpheus.’ He went on; ’And you do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
desire to hear me?’ She repeated: ’I do
not.’ ’Oh!’ he cried, ’Oh! how greatly I
am to be pitied! It is to you alone I
always wished to play. You are much
more beautiful than the others and you
would understand so much better! If you
will only listen to me for one hour, I will
procure for you everything you have ever
desired to possess.’ She replied: ’I order
you to steal the fresh food belonging to the
men of the plains. I command you to
assassinate the first one you meet. I command
you to steal the victims they have
offered to their Gods and lay them at my
feet.’ He thanked her for not demanding
more and did as she required.</p>

<p>“For an hour he played to her; but
afterwards he broke his lute and lived as
if he were dead.”</p>

<p>The Queen sighed.</p>

<p>“I never understand allegories. Explain
it to me, beloved. What does it
mean?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>“I did not tell it for you to understand.
I told you a story to calm you a little.
Now it is late. Adieu, Berenice.”</p>

<p>She began to weep.</p>

<p>“I was sure of it! I was sure of it!”</p>

<p>He laid her like a child upon her soft
bed of silky stuffs; with a smile placed a
kiss upon her tearful eyes then calmly
descended the steps of the great litter.</p>

<i>TRANSLATOR’S NOTE</i><br />
<i>TO</i><br />
<i>THE ARTIST TRIUMPHANT</i><br />
</h3>


<p><i>Parrhasius, the great painter, son of
Evenor of Ephesus, lived about four
hundred years before Christ. He was a
mighty master of his profession, and
particularly excelled in strongly expressing
the violent passions. He was blessed
with wondrous genius and invention, and
was particularly happy in his designs.
He acquired great reputation by his
pieces, but by none more than that in
which he allegorically represented the
people of Athens with all the injustice,
the clemency, the fickleness, timidity, the
arrogance and inconsistency which so eminently
characterized that amazing nation.
He once entered the lists against Zeuxis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and when they had produced their respective
pieces, the birds came to pick, with the
greatest avidity, the grapes which Zeuxis
had painted. Parrhasius immediately
exhibited his piece, and Zeuxis said,
“Remove your curtain, that we may see
the painting.” The curtain was the painting.
Zeuxis acknowledged himself conquered
by exclaiming, “Zeuxis has deceived
birds, but Parrhasius has deceived
Zeuxis himself.” Parrhasius grew so vain
of his art, that he clothed himself in purple
and wore a crown of gold, calling himself
the king of painters. He was lavish in his
own praises, but by his vanity too often
exposed himself to the ridicule of his
enemies.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>


<p>In the green gardens of white Ephesus
we were two young learners, or apprentices,
with the aged Bryaxis, the sculptor. He
was sitting upon a seat made of stone as
pallid as his face. He did not speak, but
lightly struck the earth with the end of his
staff. Out of respect for his great age
and his greater glory we stood patiently
before him. Our backs leaned against two
dark cypress trees. We did not talk, but
eagerly listened for him to speak. Motionless
we studied him with homage of which
he appeared to be conscious. We knew
that he had survived all those whom we
had longed to know. We loved him to
reveal his spirit to us, for we were simple-hearted
children, born too late to have
heard the voices of heroes. We sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to trace the almost invisible bonds that
united him to his striking, astonishing lifework.
That brow had conceived, that hand
had helped to model a frieze and twelve
figures for the tomb of Mausolus, the King
of Caria, whose tomb was a wonder of the
world: the five Colossi erected in front of
the town of Rhodes, the Bull of Pasiphæ,
that made women dream strange dreams,
the formidable Apollo of bronze, and the
Seleucus Triumphant. The more I contemplated
their author, the more it seemed
to me that the Gods must have fashioned
with their own hands this sculptor, in order
that he might be the means of revealing
them to men!</p>

<p>All at once a rush of feet, a whistle, and
a cry of a gay heart; the young Ophelion
bounded among us.</p>

<p>“Bryaxis,” cried he, “hear what all the
city knows already. If I am the first to tell
thee I will make an offering to Artemis.
But first let us make our salute: I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
forgot.” He now looked towards us, as if
to say, “Prepare yourselves well for what
I am about to tell you.” Then he began
thus: “You know, revered one, that
Clesides painted the portrait of the
Queen?”</p>

<p>“People have spoken about it to
me.”</p>

<p>“But the end of the story ... has that
also been told to you?”</p>

<p>“Is there indeed a story then to tell?”</p>

<p>“Is there a story?... You are ignorant
of it all! Listen. Clesides came expressly
from Athens. They took him to the Palace.
The Queen was not yet ready; she permitted
herself to be late. Finally she presented
herself, scarcely saluting her artist,
and then posed&mdash;if one could call it posing.
It now seems that she continually
moved, under the pretext that Love had
given her a cramp. Clesides drew in a
very bad humour, as you may imagine.
His rough sketch was not even finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and lo! the Queen wishes to pose for her
back....”</p>

<p>“Without a reason?”</p>

<p>“For the reason that&mdash;so she said&mdash;her
back was as perfect as the rest of her body,
and must appear in the picture. Clesides
might well protest that he was a painter
and not a sculptor, that one does not turn
a picture to see its back; that one cannot
draw a woman seen from every side upon
the one flat plane of a picture.... The
Queen merely responded that it was her
will; that the laws of art were not her laws;
that she had seen the portrait of her sister
as Persephone, of her mother as Demeter;
and that she, Queen Stratonice, by her sole
self, wished to pose for the ’Three Graces.’”</p>

<p>“That was not such a stupid idea of
hers.”</p>

<p>Our comrade appeared to take umbrage
at this remark.</p>

<p>“Supposing that Clesides had replied,
’No’? He was free to do so, one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
think. It is not the custom to give orders
to the artist. Such a thing as that we could
<em>not</em> support. Never would her father
Demetrius have done such a thing. Why,
when he laid siege to Rhodes, where at
the time Protogenes was at work, Demetrius
refused to fire that part of the city
where the sculptor worked.”</p>

<p>“I know that story. Continue,” said
Bryaxis.</p>

<p>“Very well; I will be short with it.
Clesides was very angry, but did not show
it. He finished his study of the back, and
the Queen rose, asking him to return on
the morrow; he accepted, and left. Very
good. On the morrow what awaited him?
A servant, saying that the Queen Stratonice
was fatigued, and would not pose
any more. The servant was to pose for
her until the portrait was finished. <em>That</em>
was what the Queen had desired!”</p>

<p>We shook with mirth, and Bryaxis
joined us therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Ophelion then continued gaily&mdash;</p>

<p>“The slave was not badly made.
Clesides gave her the same reason to be
cramped that her mistress had, and then
said in a dry way that he did not want her
any more, and took himself and his drawings
home.”</p>

<p>“He certainly did right that time,” I
said. “The Queen was merely mocking
him all the while.”</p>

<p>“Well, on the way home, as he passed
near the port, he saw a mariner whom some
one had told him the Queen had given
herself to&mdash;though there was no proof of
it. The man was Glaucon&mdash;you know him
well by sight. Clesides got the fellow to
come home with him, and pose for four
days. At the end of that time he had
finished painting two scandalous little
pictures, representing the Queen in the
arms of the sailor, firstly facing the beholder,
and then with the back showing.
These pictures he fastened at night to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
wall of the Palace of Seleucus. He then
doubtless fled, after this public vengeance,
on some vessel, for there is said to be no
trace of him. The Queen knows of it
already, and if she is furious at heart she
hides it marvellously.</p>

<p>“During the whole of the morning an
enormous crowd defiled before these scandalous
paintings. Stratonice was told of
it, and desired to see them herself. Accompanied
by twenty-five people of her
court, she stopped before the two subjects,
approaching and then retreating as though
the better to judge of their artistic or truthful
aspect in detail and in general. I was
there, and as I followed her glances with
a feeling of horror, wondering whom she
was going to slay when her anger reached
its highest point, she said: “I do not know
which is the best; both are excellent!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bryaxis, in the midst of our exultation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
lifted merely his eyebrows, and so gave to
his face the fine old lines that denoted
surprise.</p>

<p>“She proved that she is not less witty
than impudent,” said he. “The whole
story is very curious; but why do you seem
to be so proud of or pleased with its hero?
It seems to me that the part played by the
model is a very important one.”</p>

<p>“If the Queen had dared,” said
Ophelion, “she would have pursued
Clesides even to the far-off seas, and there
have had him killed as one might kill a
dog. But then, through all the violet land
of Greece she would have been considered
none other than a barbarian woman&mdash;she
who wishes to be thought a thorough
Athenian. Stratonice holds Asia in her
hand as though it were a fly, and she has
drawn back before a man who has for
weapon only a tablet and stylus....
Hereafter the Artist is the king of kings,
the sole inviolable being living under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
sun. Now you see why it is that we are so
proud!”</p>

<p>The elder man made a very disdainful
movement of the mouth.</p>

<p>“Thou art young,” he replied. “In my
time we said the same thing, and perhaps
with greater reason. When Alexander
timidly tried to explain why such and such
a picture seemed to be fine, my friend
Apelles caused him to be silent by saying
that he was making the boys laugh who
ground up the colours; and Alexander
made his excuses! Ah, well! I do not
believe that such tales really repay one
for telling them. Whatever may be the
attitude&mdash;the respect or arrogance&mdash;of the
King towards contemporary painters, the
pictures are not any the better, or any the
worse, for it all. It is a matter of indifference.
On the other hand, it may be good,
and even noble, for an artist to dare and to
be able to put himself <em>not</em> above the King
marching with an army near the walls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
his home, but above all human laws, or
even divine laws, when the Muses, his inspiring
spirits, sway him.”</p>

<p>Bryaxis was now standing. We murmured
in wonder&mdash;</p>

<p>“But who has done that? Of whom do
you speak?”</p>

<p>“None, perhaps,” came the answer of
the older man, and there was in his eyes
the hazy look of the dreamer, “unless the
great Parrhasius.... Did he do wisely,
I wonder? I used to believe so, but to-day
I doubt and know not what to think
about it.”</p>

<p>Ophelion flung me an astonished look,
but I could not enlighten him in any way
as to the meaning behind the words of the
aged artist.</p>

<p>“We do not understand you, Bryaxis,”
he said.</p>

<p>He hinted, to put us upon the right way,
“The Prometheus of Parrhasius.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what can you tell us of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you not know how Parrhasius
painted the Prometheus of the Acropolis?”</p>

<p>“No. We have not been told how it
was done.”</p>

<p>“You do not know of that amazing
scene&mdash;the deathly tragedy and alarums
from whence that picture emerged, bloodstained?”</p>

<p>“Speak. Tell us all the scene; we know
nought of it.”</p>

<p>For an instant Bryaxis let his regards
rest upon our young faces, as if he hesitated
to burden our spirits with such a
memory. Then he said with decision&mdash;</p>

<p>“Very good. I will tell you all.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>


<p>That which I am going to relate to you
took place in the year in which Plato died.
I was then in Halicarnassus engaged upon
my part of the labour that was to produce
at last the great tomb of King Mausolus
the Long-haired. It was a thankless task
if ever there was one. Scopas, who directed
all of us, had decided to decorate the whole
of the eastern front of the monument himself,
so that from the early morning sunrise
when they made the sacrifices the
marbles of our master were resplendent in
the full light and, truly, people saw little
of the other work.</p>

<p>To his comrade of the chisel, Timotheus,
he had given the lateral face of the
monument, south; less interesting and
more extended. Leochares was entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
with the western front. As for me, I had
taken that side others had not wished for&mdash;the
northern, an enormous piece of work
perpetually in the shadow.</p>

<p>(Pithis was also employed in raising a
pyramid over this stately monument and
the top was adorned by a chariot harnessed
to four horses. The expenses of this
edifice were immense, and this gave an
occasion to the philosopher Anaxagoras to
exclaim when he saw it: “How much
money changed into stones!”)</p>

<p>During five years I sculptured Victories
and Amazons that looked, in the sun, like
living women; but each time it became
necessary for me to fix one for ever in the
shadow of the monument it seemed to me
that the look of life died out of the stone
form, and then my tears came. At last my
task came to an end. I occupied myself
with preparations for returning into Attica.
In that year, as to-day, the Ægean Sea was
not very safe. War everywhere and strife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
between one city and another. Athens besides
was vanquished. The day upon
which I wished to take my departure I
could not find a ship-master, or owner of
a privateer, who had any desire to go to
the Piræus. The people of Caria, good
dealers, turned towards the vanquisher,
and from the time that the taking of
Olynthus had let Chalcis fall into the
hands of the Macedonians, all the merchants
of Halicarnassus filled out their
sails for Eubœa in order to sell there
silken robes of Cos to the courtesans
of Cnidus, where Venus was the chief
deity.</p>

<p>I also departed for Chalcis. The voyage
by sea was unpleasant to me. I was not
treated well even in the little corner of the
vessel that I professed to be satisfied with.
My name in those days had not the same
sound and fame as it has to-day and the
great monument to Mausolus was too new
and too near to men’s minds. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
voyagers upon the ship contented themselves
with knowing that I was a citizen of
Athens. That quite sufficed and they
mocked, for Athens then was an unfortunate
city. One morning when the sun was
high we landed at Chalcis in the midst of
an immense crowd in which I lost myself,
and with pleasure. In questioning some
one I learnt that there was outside the
gates an extraordinary market. Philip, at
the fall of Olynthus after having destroyed
the city had led into captivity and slavery
the whole of the population.</p>

<p>There were about forty-five thousand
people. The slave-market to dispose of
these had been on about two days and
might last for three months. Also the city
was thronged, full of strangers&mdash;purchasers
and people suffering from curiosity.
My interlocutor who was a dealer in wines
did not complain, but he confided to me
that his neighbour who sold slaves as a
rule very dear was ruined. I heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
tavern-keeper say with many gestures:
“Consider, a Thracian of twenty years of
age one knows what he is worth, by all the
Gods. When one has bought twelve to
cultivate land one counts twelve bags of
gold. Now mark the price, it has fallen to
fifty drachmas. Judge of the others by that
only. Such a thing has never been heard
of. There are three thousand virgins
for sale. They will go for twenty-five
drachmas apiece, and please do not think
that I speak rashly on the subject. Perhaps
a few drachmas more may be got for
those of the whitest skins. Ah! Philip is a
great king indeed!”</p>

<p>This man wearied me and I separated
from him and followed the multitude beyond
the open gates of the city to the vast
stretch of country where the Olynthians
were camped. With great pains I wore
myself a way through the many groups
in movement. Suddenly I saw pass near
me a procession that was extravagant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
majestical. Before it the crowds parted to
left and right.</p>

<p>Six Sarmatian slaves advanced in pairs,
armed. Behind them a little Ethiopian
held horizontally a long cross of cedar
decorated with gold. It was the stick of
the Master. Finally, gigantic and heavy,
crowned with flowers, the beard impregnated
with perfumes and clad in an enormous
purple robe, I saw Parrhasius himself. He
walked as though he scorned and spurned
the earth beneath his feet. Each arm was
around the shoulders of a beautiful girl.
He was like the Indian Bacchus.</p>

<p>His eyes fell upon me and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you are not Bryaxis who gave you
permission to bear his face?”</p>

<p>“And you. If you are not the son of
Semele who has given you that Dionysiac
stature and that robe of purple woven by
the Graces of Naxos?”</p>

<p>He then smiled upon me, and without
lifting his arms away from their charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
supports he seized and shook my hand,
pressing it against the bared breast of one
of his companions.</p>

<p>“Chariclo,”&mdash;this to the young girl upon
his right,&mdash;“take an arm of my friend and
let us continue our promenade. Soon the
sun will become too fierce to be pleasant.”</p>

<p>We therefore as he wished went on
enlaced. Parrhasius walked with a grand
heavy balancing of the body, measured
and pompous as an hexameter, the little
steps of the women were as a dactyl. In
a few words he inquired of my works and
my life. At each of my responses he said
with vivid words, “Yes. I understand perfectly.”
He wished to cut short any
lengthy speech. Then he began to speak
of himself.</p>

<p>“Clearly understand that I have taken
you under my protection,” said he. “For
not one citizen of Athens, save myself
alone, is out of danger when near the
Macedonian. If the least little trouble had
brought you before their Court of Justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
I would not have given two copper
coins for the value of your liberty. But
now, maintain a tranquil mind.”</p>

<p>“I am not,” I responded, “of a fearsome
nature, but here in the shadow of your
mighty name&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Parrhasius. “When Philip
knew that I was going to honour his new
city he sent forward upon my route an
officer of the palace. This man brought
me royal presents, among others the six
colossal men slaves and the two beautiful
girls that you have seen. That is
to say Force to open my path before me
and Beauty to grace my person.”</p>

<p>“Girls of Macedonia?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Macedonians of Rhodes,” came the
laughing answer.</p>

<p>And then Parrhasius with a generous
gesture of gift said&mdash;</p>

<p>“They shall both brighten your bed
this night. As for me I have others left
with my valuables. But you are alone,
friend. Accept these rosy flowers of flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
from my hands. Their bright youthful
skins will be strikingly beautiful contrasted
with a couch of sombre purple....”</p>

<p>We approached the great market. He
stopped and regarded me.</p>

<p>“Indeed, you do not even ask me what
it is that I come here to seek!”</p>

<p>“I would not dare.”</p>

<p>“Can you divine it?”</p>

<p>“No; certainly not. I do not think you
can want slaves, for Philip gives you his
own. Nor girls, since as you say....”</p>

<p>“I have come from Athens to Chalcis
to find a model, my friend. Now you seem
to be surprised.”</p>

<p>“A model for you. Are there not any
then between the Academe and the
Piræus?”</p>

<p>“Yes: about half a million&mdash;for me,”
he said majestically. “All Athens. And
yet I seek a model at the sale of the
Olythians. You shall hear why, and you
will comprehend.”</p>

<p>Here he drew himself up proudly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall make a Prometheus.”</p>

<p>In saying this his face expressed the
horror that the subject of Prometheus
would have.</p>

<p>“There is a Prometheus (of some sort
or the other) under every portico, as
you know. Timagoras made and sold
one; Apollodorus has attempted another.
Zeuxis has believed that he has the power
to ... but why bring back to our memory
so much piteous painting. <em>The</em> Prometheus
has never yet been given to the
world.”</p>

<p>“That I fully believe,” I replied to the
Master.</p>

<p>“They have represented peasants naked
and attached to rocks made of wood.
Their faces were distorted by a grimace
of some sort, a mere face-ache. But, Prometheus
the forger of fire, and creator
of the man and his struggle with the eagle-god....
Ah! No one has yet created
that, Bryaxis. Such a Prometheus, one of
the greatest grandeur, I see as plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
before me, created by my brain, as I see
your face. That is the type of Prometheus
that I wish to nail to the walls of the
Parthenon.”</p>

<p>Saying that he quitted the support of
his girl companion, took his wand of wood
and gold, and traced great waves of outline
in the air.</p>

<p>“For two months I have worked upon
my great scheme. I have found splendid
rocks in the domain of Crates, at the Promontory
of Astypolus. All these studies
were finished, the foundation of my picture
ready, the line of the figure in its place.
All at once I find my way barred before
me. I fail to find a head. If it was merely
a question of a Hêrmes, an Apollo or Pan,
all the citizens of Athens would be proud
to pose before me. But to take for model
a man whose face is shining with genius
and to tie, or bind, him by the ankles, the
hands, no, you can see that is not possible.
One cannot dislocate his limbs like the
limbs of a slave. We lack slaves who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the heads of freeborn Greeks. Ah, well,
Philip brings us some like that, and I come
to buy where Philip comes to sell.”</p>

<p>I shuddered.</p>

<p>“An Olynthian. One of the vanquished.
But where do you intend to finish this
picture?”</p>

<p>“At Athens.”</p>

<p>“Upon the soil of Athens your slave
will be free.”</p>

<p>“He will be&mdash;when I wish it, and not
before.”</p>

<p>“But then, if you treat your captive so,
have you no fear whatever of what the
laws will say?”</p>

<p>“The laws?” questioned Parrhasius
with a smile. “The laws are in the hollow
of my hand, even as are the folds of this
mantle that I now throw over my shoulder,
behind me!”</p>

<p>And with a magnificent movement he
seemed at the same time to enwrap himself
with purple and with the sun.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>


<p>The market for the sale of the Olynthians
now stretched before us. As far as
one could see, and forming in a straight
line six large parallel ways, platforms of
planks were erected upon tressels at a
height of about a yard from the ground.
The population of an entire city was there
exposed before the population of another
city: the one as merchandise, the other
as purchaser. Twenty-five thousand men,
women and children, their hands bound
behind the back, the ankles shackled with
loose cords, waited, for the most part
standing&mdash;waited the unknown master who
was yet to come, purchase, and lead them
to some, to them, unknown place on
Grecian soil. One soldier guarded forty;
servants in crowds circulated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
bread and water needed for the sustenance
of such a host of slaves. A great and
murmurous noise perpetually ascended to
the sky. It was like the sound of a great
feast.</p>

<p>Parrhasius penetrated into the principal
“street” of slaves, where were exposed for
sale young men and young girls who
appeared for one reason or another to be
of the sort that would command a high
price. To my great astonishment I did
not catch in their eyes any great expression
of sadness. They seemed merely curious.
Human sadness and misery, for youth that
is, has its certain measure, and they saw
their sorrows were about to pass or be
moderated by the care of a master. From
the time of the ruin of their homes these
beautiful beings had experienced to the
full all that could give days and nights of
despair. The young men no doubt had
regained hope of their future escape: the
young girls perhaps dreamed of a love that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
might partly release them. By bravado or
by sheer ignorance of the fate in store they
all showed a certain good humour. The
crowd pressed around them, examining
and uncertain before making a purchase.
Few could have decided quickly in the
midst of such a vast choice. Often they
handled the slaves. Hands tested the
muscles of a leg, the delicacy of a skin, the
firmness of a breast. Then the intending
purchasers passed on hoping to find better
bargains.</p>

<p>Parrhasius halted an instant before a
girl whose tall white form was a harmony
of lines.</p>

<p>“Behold,” he said, “this is a beautiful
child.”</p>

<p>A seller at once came forward and
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>“She is the most beautiful one offered
for sale, my lord. See how straight she
is and white. Sixteen years old yesterday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eighteen years,” rectified the young
girl.</p>

<p>“You lie, by Zeus! She is but sixteen
years, my lord; do not credit her when she
says otherwise. Look at her black locks
lifted up by this comb. When she uncoils
her hair it falls to the knees. Look at her
long white fingers, untouched by any labour.
She is the daughter of a senator.”</p>

<p>“Speak not of my father,” said the girl
gravely.</p>

<p>“She is beautiful as a water-nymph,
supple as a sword, and a virgin&mdash;as at her
birth.”</p>

<p>The man disrobed her with cynical
hands, but Parrhasius struck the earth with
his stick, and muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Virgin, you say? I care not whether
she be a virgin or not, but merely whether
she be beautiful enough. Take away her
shackles, that she may robe herself properly.
I will purchase her. What is her
name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Artemidora,” said she.</p>

<p>“Ah, good. Then know, Artemidora,
that you are for the future in the suite of
Parrhasius.”</p>

<p>She opened her great eyes wide, hesitated
charmingly, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are the Parrhasius who....”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am Parrhasius,” came the
reply.</p>

<p>Then, handing her to the care of his
guard, he again walked on. Presently he
deigned to explain to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“Bound to the Caucausus that young
girl would look charming! Nevertheless,
she will not be my Prometheus. She will
serve me as model for certain little erotic
pictures with which I ease my toils during
hours of leisure&mdash;pictures that are not,
however, the least noble part of my lifework.”</p>

<p>We walked on. The crowd had greatly
increased. The sun became more terrible
in the midst of that vast plain, without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
shadow, and in the midst of a great and
mixed concourse of people.</p>

<p>Artemidora was dressed in a white tunic,
girdle, and veil. She often turned to look
at us, and it seemed to me that when
properly robed she seemed to be another
person. Her face acquired another expression,
and she seemed anxious to glean
from one of us which was to be the man
she was fated to surrender to. Already
we had been through half the principal
street when Parrhasius stopped, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“No. That for which I seek is not
here. The youth of the body and the
beauty of the face are not found together.
I have more chance, I think, of finding
my man among slaves of the second class.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had we gone three more paces
when he extended his hand, and cried out,
“Behold him!”</p>

<p>I drew near and gazed with curiosity.
The man whom he pointed to was about
fifty years of age. Of a fine, tall figure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
excellent proportions, he had a large face;
the arch of the brows was powerful and
muscular, the nose and ears were correctly
modelled, hair grey, but beard brown and
brindled. The strong muscles of the neck
formed a sort of pedestal to his fine head,
and gave it a pose of authority.</p>

<p>Parrhasius questioned him. “What do
you call yourself?”</p>

<p>“Outis.”</p>

<p>“I do not ask you for anything, my
brave man, but the name that you received
from your father.”</p>

<p>“For a month past I have called myself
Outis. If I have ever borne another, older
name it does not please me to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It does not please me to tell you why,
Son of a Dog.”</p>

<p>Parrhasius became maddened with anger.
The seller of the slaves, alarmed, advanced
with suppliant arms.</p>

<p>“Do not listen to him, my lord. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
speaks as one who has lost his senses. It
is pure malice on his part, for he has
more brain-power than I have. He is a
physician. For science and cleverness he
had not his equal in all Olynthus. I say
what all the world would repeat, for he
was celebrated even in Macedon. People
have told me that during thirty years he
has cured more Olynthians than we were
able to kill when we took their city. This
will be a precious slave when he is chained
and has felt the rod. He plays the insolent,
but he will change his tone, as all the
others will or have done. Then, if you lead
him away with you, Death will not come
to you till your hundredth winter! Give
me thirty drachmas, and this Nicostratus
will be your thing for ever.”</p>

<p>“Nicostratus,” repeated Parrhasius to
me; “as a poet I know one of that name.
My indifference is total towards the science
of medicine.”</p>

<p>Turning towards the seller he ordered&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>“Remove his clothes.”</p>

<p>Nicostratus let this be done, powerless
and yet disdainful. Parrhasius continued
to command that the captive take up first
one position and then another. At last the
bargain was struck. Parrhasius then said,
“Superb!”</p>

<p>But I did not reply, for I felt almost
envious.</p>

<p>Fifty years have passed&mdash;the space of
a human life. I have seen hundreds and
hundreds of models, but never one worthy
to be compared with that Nicostratus the
Olynthian. He was the Statue of the Man
in all his grandeur at the full age of force
and power. I never had him as a model for
anything of mine; the unfortunate being
only posed once, and you shall learn how.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>


<p>I returned upon horseback to my own
place going through Attica. During my
five years of absence creditors had sold
the few poor goods I possessed, and I put
up very simply at a hostelry of Athens for
many weeks. Parrhasius followed after an
interval of a few days. Hearing of my
modest lodging, he at once offered me
hospitality. I went to him at once to thank
him and decline. He then lived near the
Academy, in a palace of marble and metal,
near to the little house that Plato lived in.</p>

<p>The gardens extended to the river, and
the house was surrounded by much pomp
of trees.</p>

<p>By some feebleness of the intellect that
is difficult to understand in a man of such
strength and value, Parrhasius positively
adored ostentation and every show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
wealth. His fortune was immense, and he
did not permit any one to think otherwise.
With marble, silk, gold, and beauteous
women, his abode had the air of a palace
of Artaxerxes. He greeted me upon the
threshold of the chamber that served him
for a studio. Standing robed in red silk
and crowned like an Olympian god, he
opened his large arms to me. I then penetrated
by his side into the famous salon
that had been the matrix of so many
masterpieces.</p>

<p>“My Prometheus?” he said, in answer
to my question. “No; I am yet meditating
upon that. In a few days I shall see it all
clearer. Come; look at this little thing.
It is wonderful. I have never done a more
beautiful thing.”</p>

<p>It was a picture of a sleeping nymph and
two satyrs. I saw, near, the lovely Artemidora
and two of the Sarmatians, and at once
divined that they had posed for the picture.</p>

<p>He ordered the pose to be again taken,
and continued the painting before me.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>


<p>I remained an entire month at Athens,
occupied with my own personal affairs;
and these did not allow me time to return
to the house of the great painter. Athens
was truly in mourning since the fall of the
Olynthians. The slave-market at Chalcis,
the sale of a people, such a scandal and
insult was the subject on all tongues, and
the dream of all those who were silent.</p>

<p>One day it was known that in Athens
a citizen held captive an Olynthian woman.
The citizen was condemned and executed.</p>

<p>Alarmed, I hastened to Parrhasius, and
my entreaties gained me admission to
him.... Never shall I forget the regard,
slow and grave, with which Parrhasius
greeted me when I entered. He was standing,
painting. Then, following his further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
glances, I saw, nude and bound to an
actual rock, Nicostratus the Olynthian.</p>

<p>“Cry out!” shouted Parrhasius to him;
and his awesome captive did, cursing,
foaming, and raging.</p>

<p>The face of Parrhasius did not alter
one line. He said to a Sarmatian slave:
“Upon his right; touch lightly, without
penetrating.” Nicostratus saw the man
advance, and soon his eyes swooned and
a sweat of agony came to his temples.
Moans came to the lips; then a sob, like
that of a child. Parrhasius, impassible,
studied the face; then suddenly cried out:
“The imbecile! He has died too soon.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When it was known how Parrhasius had
painted his Prometheus the people stormed
his house, crying out for death to the
murderer. At last Parrhasius appeared in
all his pomp and faced the crowd and all
its cries. Then, slowly lifting his painting,
as though offering something sacrosanct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
he showed the Athenian people the Prometheus.</p>

<p>An awesome shudder of amazement, of
wonderment at its highest, came to the
populace who saw the great picture&mdash;the
picture of human anguish and final defeat
by death. The summit, the uttermost, of
tragic grandeur seemed to be unveiled
there for the first time.... Silence, as of
a temple, held the people for a time; then
some hostile cries broke out afresh. But
they were futile, and died, lost in the
splendid thunder of glory.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HILL_OF_HORSEL" id="THE_HILL_OF_HORSEL"></a>THE HILL OF HORSEL</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<p>In the month of August eighteen
ninety-one, shortly after I had heard, at
Bayreuth, <i>Tannhäuser</i>, <i>Tristan</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>,
for the ninth time, I spent a fortnight
in the verdant Marienthal near the ancient
city of Essenach.</p>

<p>The room I occupied looked out on the
west upon the lofty Wartburg, and on the
east upon Mount Horsel, that peak which
used to be called by priests and poets the
Venusberg. The star of Wolfram appeared
in the bright sky of this land of
Wagner.</p>

<p>I was then so prone to sun that after
leaning my elbows once upon the sill of
the western window before Luther’s towers
I determined never to return there even in
my dreams. The Venusberg attracted me
to it.</p>

<p>Alone, among all the neighbouring
peaks which with their coverings of black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
firs or fertile meadows formed a garment for
the earth, the Venusberg was bare and like
a woman’s swelling breast. Sometimes the
rosy dawn cast purple flesh-like tints upon
it. It palpitated; truly at certain hours
of the evening it seemed to live, and then
it appeared as if Thuringia, like a divinity
reclining in a green and black tunic,
allowed the blood of her desires to mount
to the summit of her bare breast.</p>

<p>Throughout the long evenings of each
day I watched the transfiguration of the
hill of Venus. I gazed at it from afar. I
did not approach it. It pleased me not
to believe in its natural existence, for
exquisite is the pleasure of simplifying
realities into the pure aspect of their
symbols, and remaining at such a distance
that the eye is not forced to see things as
they are. I was afraid that once for all the
illusion would vanish never to return on
the day when I set my foot upon the
mountain itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet one morning I started. At first I
followed the Gotha Road, which is intersected
by bridges and streams overgrown
with verdure; then a path through the
fields. I had not lifted my eyes from the
meadows when three hours later I reached
the end of it. Then I looked before me.</p>

<p>Seen from near at hand, Mount Horsel
was bare and reddish, without earth, verdure,
or water upon it; it appeared to be
burned up by an internal fire as if the
legendary curse continued to arrest at its
base all the fresh vegetation which gave life
to the other mountains. The path I followed
was made of stones and dead lichen, and
was sometimes quite indistinct amid a stony
desert, while at other times it was narrowly
enclosed between high and rusty rocks. It
ascended to the summit, where a little grey
house had been built with thick walls to
stand against the violence of the wind.</p>

<p>I entered the house and discovered that
I could lunch there. Lunch upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Venusberg! That would be the last step
to my disenchantment. I accepted the
idea, to my shame, willingly enough, for in
spite of everything I was hungry.</p>

<p>The two daughters of the inn-keeper,
who was absent, served me upon a little
table a Wiener Schnitzl, which was perhaps
more Saxon than Austrian, and a
bottle of Niersteiner. This was reality
indeed. The clean, light dining-room, the
white curtains at the windows, the freshly-cleaned
floor, a light bedroom visible
through an open door, all succeeded in
convincing me that I was not lunching
with magicians, as for a moment, alas! I
had hoped. The two young girls were two
good spirits who would take no part in the
damnation of the country.</p>

<p>It is true that at the conclusion of the
meal the elder discreetly retired and the
younger one gave me a smile of invitation
which proved her natural goodness; but at
German inns the servants hardly fix any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
precise limits to the kindness they bestow
upon young travellers, and that fact does
not generally mean that they have made
a compact with a goddess of darkness.</p>

<p>We talked. She was obliging enough
to understand my German, though I spoke
it something like a negro from the Cameroons.
I asked her for some topographical
information of the country. She gave it
to me with a very good grace.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget,” she said, “to visit the
grotto.”</p>

<p>“What grotto?”</p>

<p>“The Venushoehle.”</p>

<p>“Is there a grotto of Venus?”</p>

<p>“Yes! that is its name; I don’t know
why; you must not go down the mountain
without seeing it.”</p>

<p>Uneasy and almost jealous, I wanted to
know whether many strangers came to see
this grotto, whose name alone had made
me quiver.</p>

<p>The young girl sadly replied&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>“No one! You see the mountain is not
lofty enough to tempt climbers, and it is
too high for walkers. Occasionally at
very distant intervals a sportsman from
Essenach comes to lunch or to spend the
night here; but you are the first Frenchman
I have seen since my birth.”</p>

<p>“Which is the way to the grotto?”</p>

<p>“Take the path to the left. You will
get there in five minutes. Perhaps you will
find at the entrance a man seated upon a
stone. Pay no attention to what he says:
he is mad.”</p>

<p>So there was a grotto of Venus in the
flanks of the Horselberg! But then the
country of Tannhäuser had retained the
whole of its terrible legend.</p>

<p>The grotto of the Goddess was really
there. And the man was there too.</p>

<p>It was small, elliptical at the top,
crowned with fine dark briars, and appeared
as the necessary symbol of the
mountain, as another justification of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
old German tale still more striking than
the carnal aspect of the Venusberg on the
horizon. The interior, into which I gazed,
was dark, narrow and low. Pools of water
and dark recesses made up its dark floor.
It was difficult to enter without becoming
mud-stained, but some incomprehensible
charm attracted me into the humid
darkness.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” the man said
shortly.</p>

<p>“To the bottom of the grotto.”</p>

<p>“To the bottom of the grotto? But there
is no bottom to it, sir. It is the mouth of
the earth.”</p>

<p>“Good,” I said patiently. “I will not go
far. I shall soon return.”</p>

<p>His hollow cheeks grew purple. He hit
his stick with his fist.</p>

<p>“Ah! you will soon be back! Ha! ha!
you think you can go in and out of there
at will. Do you think this grotto is a lift
or a geological curiosity? Are you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Cook’s tourist, or do you come from a
natural history museum? Have you come
to write your name upon the rock, or to
gather stones for your collection? You
think you are about to discover here subterranean
lakes, blind fish, architectural
stalactites and rocky arches covered with
crystals! You are going to study the
geology of the Venushoehle. Ha! ha! that
is admirable! Are you, too, a madman like
the others? You, also, do not understand.
You then are not aware that Venus is there
in the flesh with millions of her nymphs
around her and they are more living than
you are, since they are immortal.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I said, “I believe what you tell
me; but you very much misjudge me if
you think that the presence of Venus will
prevent me from entering here.”</p>

<p>“Hell!” he cried.</p>

<p>“I should not be displeased to earn it as
the price of her favours.”</p>

<p>The madman made a gesture which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
evidently meant: “You do not understand
me at all.” Then he put his hands to his
forehead and began to speak.</p>

<p>“Horselberg! or rather Hoelenberg,
the Mountain of Hell! they come to thee
without being warned of thy eternal
horrors, thou who waitest for the pure,
punishest the chaste, and will consume in
eternity the wicked misers of the flesh.
They will have lived their lonely lives as
rebels to the great law divine, and they will
not know thy atrocious burning till the day
when, by the power of the Sword, the
Harbinger of Souls will plunge them into
the abyss. They have eyes and they
see not, ears have they and they hear
not, they have mouths and they do
not.... My God, they are mad! mad!
mad!”</p>

<p>Suddenly turning to me he shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>“How can you think that the Venusberg
can become a place of damnation
when it is hell itself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>I made a movement.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he groaned. “Alas! My
God!” (his hands fell from his eyes to his
beard) “Alas! shall I be the only living
person to know the truth, the truth, the
truth. Will it be all in vain that the
patriarchs have placed Venus as the
terrible antithesis of God, and will no one
understand that she is Satan? Is it all in
vain that ancient tradition has painted the
satyrs with horns, black tail, goat’s legs
and cloven hoofs: will no one realize that
they are demons? With regard to the
flames of hell, will no one in the world
understand that they are thousands of
naked women dancing ...” (he struck the
earth) “there beneath our feet!”</p>

<p>He shuddered.</p>

<p>“Ever since man has thought, written
and learned, he has said, repeated and
cried out that there is no worse torture than
love. How is it he has not foreseen that in
the world of eternal torture that punish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ment
alone will be inflicted upon him!
What other could he imagine more terrible
than it?”</p>

<p>He then assumed a position as if he were
gazing into the distance and waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it is there ... it is
there.... On the day when we shall be
nothing but rotting corpses and souls maddened
by terror, there we shall go in
crowds, all of us, all sinners, to burn in
that horrible fire which is Lust. Every day
and every hour we shall experience desire,
even to the extent of suffering, for more
and more beautiful women, and at the
moment of possession we shall see them,
as on earth, vanish in smoke. But that
which is here a spasm, a fear, a cry, a
sob,&mdash;which suffices to prepare the curse of
a human life&mdash;will be there a perpetual
tremor, uninterrupted anguish, and the
punishment of years, of centuries and of
centuries. Ah! God! such is the destiny
which awaits me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes became fixed upon a stone on
the ground. Nodding his head he went on
in a strangely changed voice&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have lived an evil life, sir; this is the
reason. I was born of Protestant parents
in the Mountain of Wartburg, that same
one where Luther, more than three centuries
ago, taught his evil doctrine. I spent
my youth in piety, and led a noble and
austere life. But from my fourteenth year
I could not look at a woman without being
assailed by terrible desire. I curbed it,
after fierce struggles which left me in the
morning with a forehead bathed in sweat
and trembling face. I thought I could
remain pure by living without love, mad
that I was, and blind to my own interests.
To remain pure I would have killed myself
with my own hand before committing any
sin. Those who have not experienced
nightly combats between religious duty and
the frantic desires of the body have not
known sorrow. I struggled thus for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
shadow, and now I know that I struggled
against God. And later I got married, sir,
but married only in the eyes of the world.
The woman and I had sworn only to unite
our souls. That was how, little by little, I
was damned for my fault of lying every
day to the law of life; and afterwards there
was not time for me to follow the path I
had missed in my youth. Ah! cursed be
virgins! for the love they have repulsed
during their brief existence will justly be
their punishment in their future state.”</p>

<p>He seized me by the arm.</p>

<p>“Listen! The sun is sinking. Now is
the time. Every evening I come here, and
sweetly the Goddess sings. She calls me
from afar; she attracts me. I come just as
at the day of my death, at the day of my
fall into the Venushoehle. Ah! do not say
a word. She is about to speak to us.”</p>

<p>I do not know whether it was these last
few words, the man’s expression, or the
grasp of his hand which persuaded me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
he was speaking truly&mdash;but tremors ran
through me and I listened.</p>

<p>I expected, not as an accident, but with
the absolute exactness of prevision, the
event predicted by the madman.</p>

<p>I can only compare my state of mind
to that of a traveller who, after seeing the
lightning, and knowing how far the storm
is, waits for the thunder.</p>

<p>The time which separated me from the
prodigy decreased first by a quarter, then
a half, then three-quarters, and at the precise
moment which I had anticipated as the
end of my waiting, <em>a breath of perfumes
carried up to us the languishing echo of
a ... Voice</em>!</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
